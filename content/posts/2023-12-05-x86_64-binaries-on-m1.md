I installed a Python 2.7.18 with `pyenv` on Apple Silicon,
and I needed that binary to be pure `x86_64`.
This was necessary because I needed to load dynamic libraries that were only available in Intel format.

It is not possible to load `x86_64` libraries into an ARM binary.
If you build a multi-arch binary, you need to remember to request Intel every time you run a Python script
which tries to load the Intel-only shared library.
With an Intel-only binary, this will work every time without additional configuration.

# Calling the Intel code in a multi-architecture binary

The `file` command will tell you if a binary is multi-architecture:

```console
$ file /bin/ls
/bin/ls: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64:Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64] [arm64e:Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64e]
/bin/ls (for architecture x86_64):	Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
/bin/ls (for architecture arm64e):	Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64e
```

You can manually call the Intel code:

```console
$ arch -arch x86_64 ls
Applications		Movies		Music
...
```

If you call a binary this way, the first time this will trigger the installation of Rosetta2 
(the Intel to ARM JIT compiler) on the Mac.

# Compiling for Intel on M1

By default, we compile for ARM (M1), and only for this architecture:

```console
$ cat hello.c

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	printf("Hello!\n");
}
$ cc -o hello hello.c
$ file hello
hello: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
```

We can call the compiler for Intel, and get an Intel-only binary:

```console
$ arch -arch x86_64 cc -o hello hello.c
$ file hello
hello: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
$ ./hello
Hello!
```

# Compiling Python for Intel only

The `pyenv` installation process uses `python-build`.
This, by default, uses the `readline` and `openssl` versions provided by Homebrew to build.
On my system, these are for ARM, so the Python will build and then fail in the linker stage.

There is an option to force a build ignoring the Homebrew-provided components, `PYTHON_BUILD_SKIP_HOMEBREW`.
This is a boolean variable: it is sufficient to set it to any value.
So:

```console
kk:~ kris$ PYTHON_BUILD_SKIP_HOMEBREW=1 arch -arch x86_64 pyenv install 2.7.18

```

This is indeed the desired binary:

```console
$ file ~/.pyenv/versions/2.7.18/bin/python2
/Users/kris/.pyenv/versions/2.7.18/bin/python2: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
```

# Building a `virtualenv` for Intel Python 2.7.18

The virtual environment for Python 2.7 has to be built with an old version of the `virtualenv` command,
which is compatible with the old Python:

We make a `testdir`, enter it and set the local Python version to the required version.
We then install an old version of the `virtualenv` command, using `pip`, globally into the old Python version.
This can then be used to create a virtual environment.

```console
$ mkdir testdir
$ cd testdir
$ pyenv local 2.7.18
$ python --version
Python 2.7.18
$ which python
/Users/kris/.pyenv/shims/python
```

Now the global installation of `virtualenv` into our Python 2.7.18 instance:

```console
$ pip --version
pip 19.2.3 from /Users/kris/.pyenv/versions/2.7.18/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pip (python 2.7)
$ pip install virtualenv
...
```

We now can call the old version of `virtualenv` from our Python 2.7.18 installation directory:

```console
$ ~/.pyenv/versions/2.7.18/bin/virtualenv venv
created virtual environment CPython2.7.18.final.0-64 in 102ms
...
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) kk:testdir kris$ python --version
Python 2.7.18
(venv) kk:testdir kris$ python
Python 2.7.18 (default, Dec  5 2023, 12:09:45)

# Profit!

And that gives us an ancient Python in a foreign machine language, so we can continue with our
software archaeology project.

```console
$ arch -arch x86_64 pip install cx_Oracle==7.3
