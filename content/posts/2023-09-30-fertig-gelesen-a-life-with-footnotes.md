Rob Wilkins was the assistant and a good friend of Terry Pratchett.
He wrote a posthumous biography, titled
[A Life With Footnotes](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B09R2B8J17).
Wilkins is now the manager of the Pratchett literary estate.

The book does what a biography is supposed to do:
It traces the life of Terry Pratchett, 
illuminating his origins and the experiences that shaped his worldview.
Filled with anecdotes and tales from his readings, from conventions, and other encounters with fans,
it sketches a portrait of a lovable, quirky personality who crafted stories in his mind and then simply penned them down.

Rob Wilkins then takes on the challenging segment of the biography and guides us through the tragic phase of Terry Pratchett:
his Alzheimer's diagnosis, the mental and physical decline, the ever-increasing loss of control, and the interplay of good and bad days,
leading up to the emotional farewell that occurred long before his physical passing.

"[Terry Pratchett: A Life With Footnotes](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B09R2B8J17)", Rob Wilkins, EUR 9,49.
