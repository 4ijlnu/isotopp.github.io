I quit often.
At least once a year, but there have been years when I have been quitting four times.

Every time before a performance evaluation, or before important meetings, I sit down and write myself a notice.
I pull up a word processor, start the empty business letter template, fill in the details and the date, and then write the three or four sentences necessary to inform my employer that the time has come to part ways.
I print this, collect the letter, fold it properly and put it into an empty unsealed envelope.


Then I pull it out, unfold it and put it in front of me.
Time to start thinking.

There are the logistics of quitting.

Mostly these are personal obligations and finances.
What is my stance with respect to payments, property, and dependants?
Could I actually go into a meeting, get fed up, pull the letter, put it on the table and walk out?

There have been times, when I was younger, where I easily could have done that.

I did not own property, was unmarried and childless.
I worked as a consultant, and travelled the world, 180 days a year spent in hotel rooms.
I did have my personal, private precautions.
An unused credit card with a 4k "Return home from any point in the world" limit, and another 400 in cash on my body at any point in time.
A coordinate transformation on my personal checking account that saw a few 10k plus as Zero, to provide immediate emergency burn fuel. 

I had this because of the frequent quitting:
I sat down, took stock, and considered what would be necessary to have a secure posture and immediate personal independence, whenever I decided that I would need it.

It is the personal equivalence of a Business Continuity Plan, but at the personal level.

When I was paying off property, being married and with a child, life became more complicated, and such things required more preparations.
They can no longer be immediate, so I needed to evaluate more often, and generally keep a posture where I could move without interrupting cash flows.
The important thing is to still own the decision, and be able to execute when necessary.

Once I have the logistics of quitting down in my mind, it is time to lift the gaze from the space in front of my feet, up to the horizon.
Where would I want to go next?

That starts with finding out where I am.
What have I done in the last few months?
What are the projects I have been part of?
What have I learned?
How have I grown?
And is the place I am in still the place that would let me grow?
Or do I have to transplant myself?

If I have to move, where to?
Where do I want to be?
What do I want to learn?
What do I want to become?
Can I do this here?
And if so, what change is needed from my environment to be able to provide this?

These are not abstract questions.
But in my mind they only become real when I sit in front of this piece of paper, and think about staying or leaving.
I have made sure I could leave if I wanted.
Now it is time to think about what I want from this place to make me stay.

I sometimes explain this to others as the story of the two contracts.

Working in IT, you always have two contracts:

One is written.
It says what your job title is, where you work, and what they pay you.
It says what your notice period is.

The other one is unwritten.
It is the unspoken agreement about the level of autonomy you have, the impact you can have, and the decisions you can be part of.
It is the environment you work in and what challenges you are allowed to face, and what you can learn from.
It is the mission you are part of, and the things you build.

Working in IT, I always signed, and I always actually quit, because of this second contract.
When it expires or is violated, it is time to actually leave.

Then it all becomes about people.

Companies by construction are usually not loyal to their employees.
In general, as organisations they can't.
Some people inside an org maybe secretly work against the objectives of the organisations and are loyal to other people.

As a person, I always work with other persons.
Over the last 30 years, it has become clear that these persons stay, even when I move.
I am part of my own personal tribe.
I have been building it, maintaining it over a few decades, and when necessary they have been there for me, and I have been there for them.

Part of the meditation of quitting is also remembering these people.
Maybe they need me.
Maybe I need them.
Maybe I miss them.
Maybe some of them have an invitation or an opportunity for me.
Holding the bond of my current second contract against the pulls from my relationships gives me an important calibration of where I am, who I am and if I am honest with myself.

Usually then I have come to some conclusion and I have a plan.
I can fold the notice back up into the envelope, put it into my jacket, and walk into that meeting.

I am now grounded, and I know my boundaries, and my goals.

I know who I am.
For some reason that seems to scare people.

Usually then I don't actually have to quit.
But being able to do that, and understanding when and why helps a lot.
