Let's talk about energy and energy use.

Energy is measured in Watt, W. 
1000 Watt make a Kilowatt, kW.

Work is energy expended for an amount of time.
1000 Watt (a Kilowatt) used for one hour is a Kilowatt-hour, kWh.

How much is a Watt?
In our graphics, a Watt is a single red pixel, right of the word cellphone
One Watt is what an iPhone uses when you are running Ice Cubes, scrolling social media.

*Zoom into this image to see the pixel. It symbolizes 1 W.*

# Media appliances

When you are using 5 W your cellphone gets hot.
It is the approximate maximum a device can use without having active cooling, a spinning fan.

A device with an active cooler such as a Mac mini uses 5 W when used normally, and up to 25 W under load.
It can use up to 50 W.

25 W is also what a typical cheap Intel laptop uses when idle.
For example, the Lenovo Yoga I once had.

80 W is what a medium large TV uses in your living room. showing the news.

80 W is also what my gaming machine uses, with a Ryzen CPU, an Nvidia 4070 and 64 GB of memory,
when idle showing steam and the Windows desktop.

400 W is what my gaming machine uses when I play.

*Typical household media consumption, Energy used. One pixel = one W.*

# Household heat

Let's walk over from the living room to the kitchen.
A lot of these household devices produce heat, for washing, drying or cooking.
At 10 Ampere, you get around 2300 W from 230 V. At 16 Ampere, 3680 W.

Most of these heaters are very simple devices: They are fully on or completely off.
So we see a lot of devices that are using either full power or almost no power.

*A Wiesheu Minimat 43s, a professional baking oven of the kind that you find in gas stations or supermarkets.
It uses single phase normal power, 16A, so that still can fit into a normal household. 
The device heats up, using 3000W, and then switches on and off to maintain temperature.
This pattern is typical for household appliances that produce process heat:
Ovens, cooking plates, washing machines, dryers.*

# Driving and charging a car

Many people now drive electrical cars.
Those that have the space often use a local charge-point that uses three-phase power at 16 A per phase to charge.
Three phases at 16 A and 230 V deliver 3 * 16 A * 230 V = 11000 W.

![](/uploads/2024/07/energy-04.png)
*Adding the charge-point, 11000 W.*

Over one hour, this uses 11 kWh of Energy.
A battery of 60 kWh that was at 10% is typically charged to 80%.

```console
>>> scale=4
>>> 60 * (0.8-0.1)
42.0
>>> ./11
3.8181
```

Charging a car with a 60 kWh battery from 10% to 80% replaces 70% of the total battery capacity, 42 kWh.
At a charge rate of 11 kW, it takes 3.8 h to charge the car.
Since charging slows down as the battery fills up, it will take approximately 4 h to complete the charge.

You could get a 3 phase, 32 A connection, for a 22 kW charge-point.
But the electricity company will charge you a lot more for that,
and it is kind of pointless.
Even a 100 kWh Tesla battery will charge from 10% to 80% in 6.5 h,
and you do not have to drive the battery to empty before you charge.

In fact, if you charge every evening, just because you can, you are going to replace what you used up this day.
For 100 km, that is typically 20 kWh or less, so the car will be back at 80% after one or two hours.

Don't get a 22 kW charge-point, it is pointless.

Many people want charge-points that can do surplus charging,
using only as much power as the solar array on their roof can provide.
Most charge-points can go from 3 phases to 1 phase, and from 16 A down to 6 A.

```console
>>> 1 * 6 * 230
1380
>>> 3 * 6 * 230
4140
```

For a single phase, you can go down as low as 1380 W at 6 A.
For three-phase, you can go down as low as 4140 W at 6 A.
That is good for 5.5 kWh or 16.5 kWh on a sunny afternoon (4 h of time at 1.4 kW or 4.1 kW).

With a proper charge controller, you could charge your electric car from the solar array of the house slowly,
but for free.
Even on somewhat cloudy days.

When driving, that car (in my case, a Renault Megane e-Tech 60 kWh) straight on a flat Netherlands Autobahn,
the car consumes 15,000 W.

*If your car shows "15 kWh being used",
it means that if you continued to drive this way for an hour, it would use 15 kWh of the battery.
It is actually using 15 kW, 15,000 W, right now.*

Motors in electrical cars are not like motors in combustion engine cars.
They can use an almost infinite amount of energy for a short amount of time.
The current the battery can provide limits their output 
(which is a function of the battery's internal resistance).
Also limiting are the thickness of the wires,
and ultimately the amount of cooling we provide for the motor.

So for a short time, the car can provide astronomical amounts of power.
The Renault Megane we used as an example further up can be
driven on the autobahn at 100 km/h with 15,000 W.
But it can consume 160,000 W (220 horsepower) for a short time to get away from the traffic light in a race.

*Hitting a Megane on the head will use 160 kW, 220 hp. [full size](/uploads/2024/07/energy-06.png)*

If you drove using that much energy for an hour, you'd use 160 kWh.
At 42 kWh of useful battery content from a 60 kWh battery,
160 kWh will be drained in 16 minutes.

```console
>>> 42/160
0.2625
```
42 kWh battery content, 160 kW used, so we will have that used up in 0.2625 h.

```console
>>> 60*0.2625
15.75
```
60 minutes to the hour, so 0.2625 of an hour are 15.75 minutes.

An electrical flow heater, dispensing water in a household, is using around 21 kW.

A Tesla V4 fast charger will provide 250000 W.

A Porsche Taycan can provide 560 000 Watt (760 hp), for a short time.

*I am opening the deep freezer door to take out the choclate ice cream, and I do not close the door properly.
The deep freezer goes into overdrive.
Since I am plotting the 1d average power, I can see how that affects the freezer:
Average goes up from 13 W to 19 W, peak from 35 W to 90 W.*

# How can I save energy?

The numbers you see here are power, not energy.
They only become energy if you are using the power over longer amounts of time.

Saving energy would mean to measure kWh, not kW, and then cut down on the kWh used.
Or even convert the household so that it generates kWh, i.e. by installing roof solar or balcony solar.

Still, kW are often a good indicator:

Driving 100 km in an electric car at 100 km/h uses 15 kWh.
Doing the same at 130 km/h uses 22 kWh.
Doing the same in a combustium engine car at 130 km/h uses 6l of diesel, 60 kWh of raw energy content.

Washing machines, dryers, and dishwashers tend to use a lot of energy, but often only for an hour or so.
A modern washer uses around 1.3 kWh to wash 7 kg of clothing.

Permanently running devices such as file-servers use a lot of energy, because they are always on.
Multiply their power by 24 to get energy.

![](/uploads/2024/07/energy-10.png)

*Running the washing machine used 1.3 kWh at 13:00.
But over the whole day, my desk and all the computers on it are using the most energy,
because the file server is running 24/7 at 100 W.*

All that energy use is completely dwarfed by driving.
Here is a day
that shows what happens when we charge the Megane e-Tech at the charge-point and the Carver S+ using a normal wall-plug.

![](/uploads/2024/07/energy-11.png)

*Charging the Megane for 20 kWh and the Carver for 7 kWh. The rest of the houses power consumption much smaller.*

Is that bad?

![](/uploads/2024/07/energy-12.png)

*On that particular day, 2024-Jul-12, we produced 38.8 kWh of energy using the solar array on our roof.
We consumed 33.9 kWh. 
Overall, we returned 4.92 kWh to the grid,
but we actually put 29.7 kWh into the grid and took 24.8 kWh out of the grid at other times.*
