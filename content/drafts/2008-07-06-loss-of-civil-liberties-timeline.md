<a href="http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/project.jsp?project=lossofcivilliberties">Loss of Civil Liberties Since 9/11</a>: <blockquote>This is the home page for the Loss of Civil Liberties Since 9/11 investigative project, one of several grassroots investigations being hosted on the History Commons website.</blockquote> und weiter: <blockquote>The Loss of Civil Liberties project covers a number of issues: the expansion of executive power (the so-called “unitary executive”), the NSA’s domestic surveillance program, the use of “national security letters” to force information from citizens, and other all-too-pertinent topics.</blockquote>
