 by David Kushner is the story of the two Johns: Carmack and Romero, and the early video game culture and the genre of the 3D first person shooter.</p>

</p>
<p>A lot of todays &ldquo;hard core&rdquo; and somewhat toxic video game culture was defined by the two Johns and the company they built, as well as the culture that followed. The book follows their personal and company history and all the tales that come with it, and shows to differently broken persons building - for a time - a very successful company and failing differently. It also shows the nascent computer industry and how the hardware we have today was built around the software of that time and vice versa.</p>

<p>Fabien Sanglard is a technology archeologist specializing in video games. His first book, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/gebbdoom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Engine Black Book: DOOM</a>

 is a unique analysis of the hardware and software that ran Doom back then, and what compromises and tricks were necessary to pull off the feat of creating a 30 fps full screen 3D animation on hardware that could not possibly actually do this.</p>

</p>
<p>If you know how to code, or if you know anything about games, demos, 3D animation, this is a truly unique tour of deep geekery and trickery.</p>
