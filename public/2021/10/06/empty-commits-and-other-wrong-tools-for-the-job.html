            Empty commits and other wrong tools for the job
	</h1>

	<p><a href="https://twitter.com/akrey/status/1445656529877680129" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This</a>

 is how you can make an empty commit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git commit --allow-empty -m &quot;Kick it&quot;
</code></pre><p>This has the disadvantage of also generating a commit message.
<a href="https://twitter.com/akrey/status/1445656529877680129" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another way</a>

 to achieve this seems to be</p>
<pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git commit --amend --no-edit &amp;&amp; git push -f
</code></pre><p>but that will make people hate you in other ways.</p>
<p>So lets stop and ask:
Why would you want to make an empty commit?</p>
<p>Most people want this because they attached a server-side action to a commit, a CI/CD activity.</p>
<h1 id="this-is-wrong">
    <a href="#this-is-wrong">
	This is wrong
    </a>
</h1>
<p>This is wrong in the same way [writing Shell Scripts]({% link _posts/2021-01-05-using-python-to-bash.md %}) is wrong:
It kind of works, but now you have another, worse problem and still no solution to the original problem.</p>
<p>You need to stop and question your life choices, and most importantly, wake up the engineer in you.</p>
<h2 id="but-i-need-to-debug-my-cicd-pipeline">
    <a href="#but-i-need-to-debug-my-cicd-pipeline">
	But I need to debug my CI/CD pipeline
    </a>
</h2>
<p>Kick it off using the tooling provided to you.
Your environment has an API that is specifically built to enable you to do that.
Use it.</p>
<p>In Gitlab:
<a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/triggers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Triggering pipelines through the API </a>

</p>
<p>In GitHub:
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow#running-a-workflow-using-the-rest-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Running a workflow using the REST API</a>

</p>
<p>This not only works reliably, you can get proper error messages.
On top of that, you just did <em>not</em> pee into your commit history.</p>
<h2 id="but-i-need-to-redeploy-because-i-need-a-terraform-run-after-i-just-lost-an-instance">
    <a href="#but-i-need-to-redeploy-because-i-need-a-terraform-run-after-i-just-lost-an-instance">
	But I need to redeploy, because I need a Terraform run after I just lost an instance
    </a>
</h2>
<p>This is fractally broken, there is breakage in your breakage.</p>
<p>The proper solution is a reconciliation loop of the kind Kubernetes has: Measure the existing state and compare it to the desired state. Then execute the actions necessary to transform the measured state into the desired state, in a loop.</p>
<p>So if you are not on K8s, you need to move to K8s or re-invent K8s for your environment, badly.
Yes, Terraform, Harness and friends have it all wrong.</p>
<p>Erecting infrastructure quickly and portably across backends surely is nice, but assumes a properly functioning declarative environment.
That is an environment where you describe the desired state of the infrastructure and the platform takes care of maintaining that desired state for you.</p>
<p>Most platforms do not work that way.
Some fake it, badly.
For example, nobody uses AWS autoscalers to autoscale, but they surely are useful to protect your instance count.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-inside-this-problem">
    <a href="#the-problem-inside-this-problem">
	The problem inside this problem
    </a>
</h2>
<p>And since we are talking about CI/CD pipelines:
Don&rsquo;t YAML them. Don&rsquo;t JSON them. Don&rsquo;t XML them.</p>
<p>All of these things surely are nice to describe static objects that have static properties.
You can successfully use any of them to express the desired state of a thing in a declarative way.</p>
<p>If you see anything that looks like &ldquo;foreach&rdquo;, &ldquo;when&rdquo;, &ldquo;unless&rdquo; or similar, it&rsquo;s procedural.
These are control structures.
They are part of programming languages.
Which any of these three are decidedly not.</p>
<p>Programming in any of these three is wrong use of tooling, and you should not do it.</p>
<ul>
<li>YAML, JSON and XML are for declarative things.</li>
<li>Python, Go and Rust are for procedural things.</li>
<li>Bash is for interactive use only.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the proper tooling for the job.
Be an engineer.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll just get your old bash rsync deployment scripts back, in a harder to debug packaging, and wrapped in conditionals and loops in YAML &ldquo;syntax&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That is not what progress looks like.
At all.
Shoddy engineering begets pager calls, outages and suffering.</p>
