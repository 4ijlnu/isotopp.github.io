	<p>I had reason to look into the UNIX Eschaton, the time when the signed 32 bit counter of seconds since Midnight, 1970-01-01 UTC overflows. Going <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time#Notable_events_in_Unix_time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Wikipedia</a>

, I learned we will die two years earlier, because in 2036-02-07, 06:28:16 UTC NTP will kill us all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At 06:28:16 UTC on Thursday, 7 February 2036, Network Time Protocol will loop over to the next epoch, as the 32-bit time stamp value used in NTP (unsigned, but based on 1 January 1900) will overflow. This date is close to the following date because the 136-year range of a 32-bit integer number of seconds is close to twice the 70-year offset between the two epochs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good to know.</p>
<p>Still, I wanted to know the state of things. <a href="https://linuxreviews.org/Year_2038_Timestamp_Problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linuxreviews</a>

 tells me that the kernel already uses a 64 bit time_t internally, so we are good for the next few billion years. Unfortunately, a lot of other structures don&rsquo;t, and some of them are persisted on disk.</p>
<h1 id="filesystems">
    <a href="#filesystems">
	Filesystems
    </a>
</h1>
<p>Extending a persistent data structure is hard, and often cannot be done in-place. In many filesystems, the inode is a tight fit and extending timestamp will double the size of an inode, going up from one power of two to the next higher power of two.</p>
<p>The ext4 filesystem <a href="https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Disk_Layout#Inode_Table" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inode structure</a>

 stores <a href="https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Disk_Layout#Inode_Timestamps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">64 bit timestamps</a>

 these days, but the conversion cannot be done in-place. Since Linux 5.4 you get a warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ext4 filesystem being mounted at (mountpoint) supports timestamps until 2038</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will need to dump these file systems, recreate them with 64 bit support and then restore the data.</p>
<p>XFS has the <code>bigtime</code> option since 5.10. It counts signed 64 bit, but at nanosecond resolution, so it is good until the year 2468.</p>
<p>NFS V4 has 64 bit timestamps with a second resolution, since 20 years. Anybody using NFS V2 or V3 already gets exactly what they deserve, so not a problem.</p>
<p>Java counts 64 bit signed values, but uses milliseconds. Good for another 300 million years. Other systems do 64 bit signed, but count microseconds. Still sufficient.</p>
<p>I am expecting the first &ldquo;Enterprise 2038 Compliance&rdquo; projects to start very soon. It will be great fun to find every single timestamp in a large enterprise and check it for 64 bit time_t. The fact that afterwards there will be different cutoff dates due to different timer resolutions will be even more fun.</p>

<p>What also can kill us: Theoretically there are <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/negative-leap-second.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative leap seconds</a>

, but no code in the world is prepared for them actually happening.</p>

<p>I was triggered by <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format" target="_blank" rel="noopener">draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format-01</a>

 speaking about &ldquo;36-bit big-endian unsigned Unix Timestamp values&rdquo; in various places. The text also contains phrases such as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example a 36-bit timestamp source would fully utilize timestamp_32 and 4-bits of timestamp_48. The remaining 12-bits in timestamp_48 MUST be set to 0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The string 2038 appears nowhere in this document.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a draft, it contains obvious typos in several place, but generally speaking UUID v7 and UUID v8 look underspecified, with different implementation variants, and have the look of untested ideas. I agree [on the general idea]({% link _posts/2020-09-22-alter-table-for-uuid.md %}) of sort-ordering UUID values PK friendly, but [having a proper UUIDv1]({% link _posts/2021-04-06-mysql-and-uuids.md %}) looks like the safer option to me.</p>
