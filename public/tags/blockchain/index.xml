      <description>In [Hashes and their uses]({% link _posts/2018-02-26-hashes-and-their-uses.md %}) we have been talking about hash functions in general, and cryptographic hashes in particular. We wanted four things from cryptographic hashes:
 The hash should be fast to calculate on a large string of bytes. The hash is slow to reverse (i.e. only by trying all messages and checking each result). The hash is slow to find collisions for (i.e. it&amp;rsquo;s hard to find two input strings that have the same hash value).</description>

      <description>A hash function is a function that maps a large number of arbitrary data types onto a smaller number of contiguous integers.
This simple hash function maps strings of arbitrary length to integers. Some strings are mapped to the same integer: a hash value collision.
The base set here is a number of strings of arbitrary length, which is a theoretically open ended set size. The target is a bounded number of integer values.</description>
