      <description>Two questions from Reddit&amp;rsquo;s /r/mysql related to Window Functions: How do I make row.numbers happen and Get the difference between two values in different recordings .
One of the new things in MySQL is the implementation of Window Functions. They are related to aggregates, but do not actually lump values together.
To better understand what goes on, let&amp;rsquo;s create some fake data to work with:
#! /usr/bin/env python3 # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import MySQLdb as mdb import MySQLdb.</description>

      <description>A question from Reddit&amp;rsquo;s /r/mysql:
 Really new to MySQL and had a request to export an entire database to csv for review. I can manually export each table using workbench but there are 10+ tables and 10+ databases so I was looking to export the entire database to csv.
 It is likely that you have additional requirements on top of this, so it would be best to script this in a way that would allow for customization.</description>

      <description>A question from Reddit&amp;rsquo;s /r/mysql:
 Hey, I was planning to make a dashboard, where Users are subjected to make edits on their profiles every now and then, and I expect a high volume of requests to the database.
Having worked previously with MySQL for another Dashboard, I encountered errors for:
  Maximum user connections - when I connected to the database only while query was to be executed</description>

      <description>A question from Redditâ€™s /r/mysql led to a longer discussion of cursors and how they are implemented in MySQL, and what the advantages and drawbacks are.
The OP probably had a slow query, but was misphrasing the question:
 I am having performance problems where my cursor is taking 6-8 seconds to go through a hundred rows. I think this is because I am also using while loops to loop through JSON objects to pull information.</description>
