      <description>Water is a very weird substance. Melting ice at 0C to water at 0C takes a fantastic amount of energy: Water has a latent heat of 384J/gram. Compared to other materials that is pretty much at the upper end of the spectrum.
Warming up 1g of liquid water by 1C is the original definition of 1 Calorie, or 4.184 Joules in todays units.
The water on our planet is a buffer that can store energy if there is more energy incoming that the earth can dissipate, or release energy if the bilancing is negative.</description>

      <description>Shared Space Experiment The Guardian has an article about a Shared Space Experiment at Amsterdam Alexanderplein.
A Shared Space is an approach to urban traffic design in which segregation of traffic modes is minimized and signage or other regulation is taken away, leaving traffic participants to make up rules and agreements on the spot through interaction. Several preconditions need to be there in order for Shared Spaces to have a chance of working:</description>

      <description>Cargobike mum with child cycling independently on Upper Thames Street. Unimaginable before cycling infrastructure. &amp;ndash; Mark Treasure A lot of people in Germany, especially Bike Activists, are stuck in the 80ies, victims of the Kampfradler mentality. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at that:
The german word Kampfradler literally is made up from &amp;ldquo;Kampf&amp;rdquo; (fight) and &amp;ldquo;Radler&amp;rdquo; (cyclist) . A Kampfradler is a fighting cyclist, or confrontational cyclist. Wikipedia dates the Kampfradler to 2011, but it&amp;rsquo;s much older.</description>

      <title>How many chargers are necessary to convert the Netherlands to electric cars?</title>
      <link>/2017/09/04/how-many-chargers-are-necessary-to-convert-the-netherlands-to-electric-cars.html</link>

      <guid>/2017/09/04/how-many-chargers-are-necessary-to-convert-the-netherlands-to-electric-cars.html</guid>
      <description>Here is the question:
 How much infrastructure do we need when ALL 8 million vehicles (and buses and trucks!) in the Netherlands go electric? The answer will surprise you: we could get to 100% electric transportation in the Netherlands, just by converting the 4000 existing gast stations to fast charging stations which have an average of 14 fast chargers.
 article then plays with numbers a bit: Kilometers driven, electricity used, number of chargepoints, charging rates.</description>

      <description>Evaluating the Changing Causes of Photovoltaics Cost Reduction Why is PV Solar Energy getting cheaper and cheaper?
 We find that increased module efficiency was the leading low-level cause of cost reduction in 1980-2001, contributing almost 30% of the cost decline. The most important high-level mechanism was R&amp;amp;D in these earlier stages of the technology. After 2001, scale economies became a more significant cause of cost reduction, approaching R&amp;amp;D in importance.</description>

      <description>The German Language podcast Lage der Nation has published an interview with Axel Friedrich on Dieselgate. Axel Friedrich has been a department lead in the German Umweltbundesamt until 2008, now working with BUND and other environmental NGOs in Germany and instrumental in uncovering Dieselgate on the German side.
The interview contains some very interesting remarks on rental car companies and car maker owned car leasing companies, and how the shape the car market.</description>

      <description>Digging through my bookmarks and open tabs was interesting. The picture of the future that emerges: With costs for energy approaching the 1 cent range per kWh, electrical energy is going to be close to free. Money can and will be charged for guarantees, because batteries or other forms of storage still cost money.
 Guardian: &amp;lsquo;Spectacular&amp;rsquo; drop in renewable energy costs leads to record global boost »The new renewable energy capacity installed worldwide in 2016 was 161GW, a 10% rise on 2015 […] The new record capacity cost $242bn, a 23% reduction in investment compared to 2015, and renewables investment remained larger than for all fossil fuels.</description>

      <description>Short link to NBC Miami :
 South Miami Set to Become First City in Florida to Require Solar Panels on New Homes The new law would require owners of new homes &amp;ndash; including single-family homes, townhouses and multi-story residential buildings &amp;ndash; to install solar panels. It also applies to owners who expand their homes by 75% or greater. Once the measure is passed, South Miami would become the fourth U.</description>

      <description>Tony Seba (Stanford University) came up with a kind of best-case scenario for electrification and decarbonization. &amp;ldquo;Rethinking Transportation 2020-2030 &amp;rdquo; sees a self-amplifiying change in how we travel and transport things:
 By 2030, within 10 years of regulatory approval of autonomous vehicles (AVs), 95% of U.S. passenger miles traveled will be served by on-demand autonomous electric vehicles owned by fleets, not individuals, in a new business model we call “transportas-a-service” (TaaS).</description>

      <description>A talk by Marco te Brömmelstroet and others about how neither the Bike nor the train themselves are a viable transport alternative, but how they together are much more than the sum of their parts:
 Nine Arguments for seeing bicycle-train as one mobility system Biking increases the catchment area of train stations, allowing an increase of the distance between stops for stop-trains, and consequently also for all higher-order trains. This speeds up the train system, making it a lot more attractive and a lot more viable.</description>

      <description>A long time ago, I wrote a text on the German Blog and on Carta: Wieso wir uns veröffentlichen (Why we publish ourselves).
In the middle of a discussion about privacy I was explaining why people publish themselves, why they publicly reveal (sometimes intimate) facts about themselves. They are doing this, I wrote, to find other like-minded people, to become searchable and to become approachable, to build trust. Trust is a wonderful thing.</description>

      <description>Autoblog titles: The race for autonomous cars is over. Silicon Valley lost . The point they want to make is:
 To paraphrase Elon Musk, Silicon Valley is learning that &amp;ldquo;Making rockets is hard, but making cars is really hard.&amp;rdquo; People outside of the auto industry tend to have a shallow understanding of how complex the business really is. They think all you have to do is design a car and start making it.</description>

      <description>In any discussion about cycling in Germany, sooner or later some geek who has been exposed to USENET shows up and then the ADFC #173 (http://bernd.sluka.de/Radfahren/fdf173.pdf) is being quoted. That&amp;rsquo;s a thing from 1992.
The usual thing happened here on Facebook - a discussion about the SolaRoad Krommenie diverged into &amp;ldquo;Cycle Paths are stupid&amp;rdquo; and then linked over to the ADFC #173.
Here is a bunch of more recent material and links.</description>

      <description>In the 2016 South Australia Blackout , a storm lead to a cascading failure, with in turn left 1/6 of the continent without electricity. Fortunately, this is not a densely populated area even for australian circumstances, so it affected some 1.5 mio people (out of 20 mio total for all of Australia) - still quite a lot of people. The news of a 73-year-old Tesla Powerwall owner powering through this outage without even noticing made the headlines in the aftermath, and in consequence demand for PV + Battery combination surged.</description>

      <title>Video: 20 Years of continuous improvement in crash safety</title>

      <guid>/2017/02/09/video-20-years-of-continuous-improvement-in-crash-safety.html</guid>
      <description>Continual improvement is sometimes hard to see, because each iteration, each incremental step itself is tiny so that the actual change escapes our attention. Also, just living our lives, our time sense is sometimes distorted. Me for example, I was almost 30 already in the late Nineties, and while that is already 20 years ago, it feels like yesterday to me. So car safety in the Nineties, compared to now? It was crap.</description>

      <title>Stockholm&#39;s congestion charge vs. Asthma</title>

      <guid>/2017/02/06/stockholms-congestion-charge-vs-asthma.html</guid>
      <description>Inside Science reports on the congestion charge in Stockholm (Link to actual paper ). Stockholm always has been a city with relatively clean air and PM10 and NOx levels well below limits. The introduction of a congestion charge in 2007 reduced air pollution in Stockholm by approximately 10 percent. Yet, after several years, Asthma in children 0-5 years old is reduced of 45 percent.
 &amp;ldquo;It appears that what they&amp;rsquo;ve found is these cumulative effects of pollution,&amp;rdquo; he said.</description>

      <description>EU Observer reports on a five page internal note from the EU director-general at the commission&amp;rsquo;s internal market and industry department:
 &amp;ldquo;Absolute NOx emissions of diesel vehicles under real driving conditions have hardly changed” despite “various” EU “steps”. “On the road, a Euro 5 vehicle emits almost the same amount of NOx per km as a Euro 3 vehicle.&amp;rdquo;
 The testing method, which is nothing like real road conditions, is mentioned as a contributing factor.</description>
