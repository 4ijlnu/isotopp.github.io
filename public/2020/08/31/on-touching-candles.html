            On Touching Candles, And Error Budgets

	<p>Ok, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dad Stories&rdquo; Time (from <a href="https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1300414521169907713" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>

). When my son was somewhat older than a year, he was learning to speak. He could already say &ldquo;Mama&rdquo; and &ldquo;Papa&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It was around Christmas, and there was a candle on the table, glowing interestingly, so he wanted to touch it. &ldquo;Nein, heiß&rdquo; is what you would say in German.</p>
<p>Of course, a toddler does not understand the meaning of &ldquo;heiß&rdquo;. I mean, he&rsquo;s trying to imitate the sound of it, but the meaning of &ldquo;heiß&rdquo; is something specific. We connect an experience with the word. Something that any child can only learn by touching the candle. There is literally no other way to learn it.</p>
<p>So the only thing I could do for him was to get a wet cloth and let him touch the candle. Safely. He did. He cried. I applied the wet cloth and soothing words. And the third word he learned was &ldquo;heiß&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Computer Science is a lot like this, for some reason.</p>
<p>People know here (<em>touches head</em>), for example by reading the SRE book or other stuff. You can ask them, and they will repeat the key learnings from the book back to you correctly.</p>
<p>But they do not know here (<em>touches heart</em>), and they will still build centralized Zookeepers.</p>
<p>It requires a few outages until they know here (<em>touches gut</em>) how to design systems properly and what is important in design.</p>
<p>So that person over there, with the centralized Zookeeper cluster. And that person over there with the schemaless, <a href="http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2012/05/configuration-complexity-clock.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much simpler config language</a>

. And that one yonder, with the (type, length, value) BER-like data format. I could tell you &ldquo;heiß&rdquo; and you would not <em>understand</em>.</p>
<p>Go and touch that candle. It&rsquo;s the only way to learn <em>properly</em>.</p>

<p>I lament that so many orgs/people/uptimes have to suffer to build the wisdom.</p>
<p>I dream of a university/bootcamp of &ldquo;candle touching&rdquo; where learners practice scaling a service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another &ldquo;Dad Story&rdquo;: I once worked at a company which used to own the domain <a href="https://wahl.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wahl.de</a>

 (&ldquo;election.de&rdquo;). They did not do much with it, they usually gave it do apprentices to play with. Usually the apprentices built elaborate PHP based websites that did pre-election mix- and match &ldquo;Find the party that matches my interests&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Never did the apprentices stop to consider what will happen on election day, Sunday at 6pm. Because that&rsquo;s when the die is cast, so hordes of people will drop onto the site and what they want - the <em>only</em> thing they want - is the results, as they develop. With no amount of hardware running PHP you will be able to handle this.</p>
<p>And that does not matter, because all you need at that time is a single static page, updated in the background, with current results.</p>
<p>But the thing is - as an apprentice, you only learn - like &ldquo;<em>touches gut</em> really learn&rdquo; -  when you had that site burn down underneath you in the most critical way.</p>
<p>So we let them.</p>
<p>Yes, we could make it safer. Yes, we could have warned them. Yes, we could have gently steered them towards a curated, safe solution. We didn&rsquo;t. It was <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru_scenario" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kobayashi Maru</a>

 all the way. It was quite important to let them do it, and let them fail at it, the real thing.</p>
<p>Or as <a href="https://twitter.com/mausdompteur/status/1300439329614057473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a good friend phrases it</a>

:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Error Budget&rdquo;: How much infrastructure you&rsquo;re allowed to set on fire to learn the meaning of the word &ldquo;heiß&rdquo;. Every organization has an error budget, but most don&rsquo;t plan for it.</p>
