            Strong weak ties
	</h1>

	<p>A long time ago, I wrote a text on the German Blog and on Carta:
<a href="http://www.carta.info/41830/wieso-wir-uns-veroffentlichen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wieso wir uns ver√∂ffentlichen</a>


(Why we publish ourselves).</p>
<p>In the middle of a discussion about privacy I was explaining why people
publish themselves, why they publicly reveal (sometimes intimate) facts
about themselves. They are doing this, I wrote, to find other like-minded
people, to become searchable and to become approachable, to build trust.
Trust is a wonderful thing. It is the powerful assumption that most people
most of the time want to help you and that falsely trying out to trust
people is a recoverable mistake. Having trust and being in a trustworthy
environment keeps transactional costs low and makes cooperation possible.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s rewarding and awesome. How does this work in practice?</p>
<p>So tomorrow there is <a href="http://www.messefrankfurt.com/frankfurt/en/besucher/welcome/messeveranstaltungen/messen/entertainment-media-creation/prolight_sound2017.html?nc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pro Light and Sound in Frankfurt</a>

.
Sammy wants to go there, and gets the combination ticket. That&rsquo;s admission
to the trade show, plus a ticket for German rail. That ticket is being
delivered as a Bahn Tix code, which you can
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypxepZLxff8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">punch into any German ticket machine</a>


and get a printout. We are in the Netherlands. The next ticket machine is in
Venlo. The route she&rsquo;s going to use does not pass Venlo. There is
<a href="http://praxistipps.chip.de/bahntix-online-ausdrucken-geht-das_44999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no way to get Bahn Tix online</a>

.</p>
<p>I am asking on Google plus for help, and because I know at least one person
following me is a Train Driver I mention them into the thread. Sammy, me and
that person get into a Hangout. Ticket is being picked up and given the
train driver of ICE 220 FFM -&gt; Amsterdam Centraal. Shift change at the
border, ticket travels on to Amsterdam, +30 platform change 7b -&gt; 2.
Printed Ticket is being successfully delivered from the engine to Sammy at
11:58.</p>
<p>This is a direct application of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_ties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interpersonal Ties</a>


theory (pointing to article by
<a href="https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/the_strength_of_weak_ties_and_exch_w-gans.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Granovetter</a>


(1973) and in a way to the works of
<a href="https://www.amazon.de/Ultrasociety-Years-Humans-Greatest-Cooperators/dp/0996139516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter Turchin</a>

.
High trust societies are societies where people have
<a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/weak_ties.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many weak ties</a>

,
that can be strengthened as demand arises. It&rsquo;s these strong weak ties that
enable (inter-) action and where cooperation wins between people are
highest. In order to have strong weak ties, a society needs to have a
relatively low and controlled wealth difference
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gini coefficient</a>

) and a
working judicial system and low corruption. This creates social cohesion,
and enables &ldquo;random&rdquo; cooperation.</p>
<p>Also, you win friends. Looking forward to a visit, soon.</p>
