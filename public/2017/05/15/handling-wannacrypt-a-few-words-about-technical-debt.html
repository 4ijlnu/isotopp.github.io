            Handling Wannacrypt - a few words about technical debt
	</h1>

	<p>So Microsoft had a bug in their systems. Many of their sytems. For many
years. That happens. People write code. These people write bugs. Microsoft
over the years has become decently good with fixing bugs and rolling out
upgrades, quickly. That&rsquo;s apparently important, because we all are not good
enough at not writing bugs. So if we cannot prevent them, we need to be able
to fix them and then bring these fixes to the people. All of them.</p>
<p>The NSA found a bug. They called it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETERNALBLUE</a>

 and they have been
using it for many years to compromise systems. In order to be able to
continue doing that they kept the bug secret. That did not work. The bug is
now
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MS17-010</a>


or a <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole list</a>


of CVE-entries.</p>
<p>The NSA told MS about the bug when they learned that it had leaked, but not
before. Microsoft patched the bug in March 2017, even for systems as old as
Windows XP (which lost all support in 2014), but many people did not install
the patch. The result is &ldquo;the largest cyberattack in the world&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I get that some systems can&rsquo;t be patched for various reasons. What I can&rsquo;t
fathom is why those same systems might be exposed to the Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, here is the thing: It is 2017. Every system is somehow exposed to the
Internet. Often that happens indirectly or unintentionally, but it always
happens. There is no such thing as an isolated network any more, ever,
anywhere.</p>
<p>Maybe you think there is, but that only means that you haven&rsquo;t found the
connection, yet. But everything, even those embedded systems, especially
these embedded systems, need to somehow report stuff, be monitored, or
otherwise connect to other systems to be useful.</p>
<p>System integration has become so tight that you simply cannot afford to have
an isolated system. If you had one, you would be losing business
opportunities that are more valuable than the cost of managing network
security.</p>
<p>That means you need to defend each and every endpoint, of course, which is
only possible if you beef up these endpoints with enough CPU, power and
cooling that they can actually spend the energy to defend, and then keep
their software up to date.</p>
<p>That of course conflicts with the concept of validated, certified and
unchangeable systems. And with the concept of sell once, and be rid of it
for the coming 30 years. So both these things still exist in the minds of
managers and product designers from the last millenium, but not really any
more in the universe of 2017.</p>
<p>If you are one of these pre-millenial types, you haven&rsquo;t been paying
attention. You have missed Tesla, which pretty spectacularly updates a whole
fleet of embedded mobile devices in the field, after sale, and managed to
turn this into an actual feature that customers love, creating a much
tighter bond between maker and customer than would be possible without it.
Tesla now even rolls out hardware in advance, without the software actually
being able to make best use (or any use at all) of the hardware, and then
later incrementally upgrades the software leveraging the spare hardware,
compute and memory in the devices.</p>
<p>You also missed things such as Patch Tuesday, a thing that Microsoft came up
with to turn system changes into a recurring operational event instead of a
migration project.</p>
<p>This is a key concept. When there is a new version, that new version needs
to actually get out into the field, to all systems, within a pre-determined
time. You get to choose that time, within limits, but it needs to be counted
in days. 20 work days (1 month) is a good target for a beginner.</p>
<p>As KPIs go, you probably need to <em>build process and infrastructure to get
out any pre-determined version of anything to at least 95% of your complete
fleet within 20 workdays as part of normal operations without a special
migration project.</em></p>
<p>If do not have that, it means that old versions of things accumulate. That
is a very real problem not only in the case of MS17-010, but also in many
other ways.</p>
<p>Whenever things manifest as &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do that, because &lt;<em>something old gets
in the way</em>&gt;&rdquo;, that is technical debt. It means that your technical
infrastructure ossified and tactical and strategic decisions are being
made on the ground of technical limitations instead of actual tactical and
strategic needs. Constraints are being accumulated in your systems, until
you can&rsquo;t move any more when you must, and the system breaks down.</p>
<p>You can put numbers to that, and counts of broken systems, broken processes,
lost business opportunities and lost partners and customers because of a
lack of trust into the security of your systems, because of a lack of trust
into your ability to actually manage the problem or a lack of trust into
your ability to maintain such a thing on a long term perspective.</p>
<p>The TODO list for management, one more time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Key ability: to be able to make changes to the entirety of the fleet of
devices in the field, within a hard time limit, counted in days, as part
of a normal operational procedure.</p>
<p>Key ability: to actually be able to get changes from the upstream vendors
of all software components that are part of the build, for the planned
lifetime of the product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now look around. These ticket vending machines and arrival displays in train
stations, the ATMs next to it, the control software for the escalators and
elevators, the control systems for the building electricity, traffic lights,
and the cars engines,â€¦ And the smart phones in the pockets of all the
people around you.</p>
<p>And not few of these systems have planned lifetimes of decades.</p>
<p>The NSA policy of keeping this kind of bugs secret instead of working to the
goal of making all computers more secure can also be translated into
numbers. In this case numbers representing losses and  gains. However, the
losses accrued in this single incident are potentially already larger than
the wins made by using ETERNALBLUE. But they are not the NSA&rsquo;s losses. Maybe
the incentives here are not completely aligned and need checking.</p>
