            The Measles vs your immune system

	<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/05/07/404963436/scientists-crack-a-50-year-old-mystery-about-the-measles-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPR has an article</a>


about the measles. It is already known that after a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measles infection</a>

 the immune system goes
down for a few weeks and followup infections are common. It seems that what
the infection does is worse than that. With the introduction of measles
vaccination it has been observed that <em>other infections</em> went down within
2-3 years after measles immunization took place. Researchers wanted to know
why and found evidence that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like many viruses, measles is known to suppress the immune system for a
few weeks after an infection. But previous studies in monkeys have
suggested that measles takes this suppression to a whole new level: It
erases immune protection to other diseases, Mina says. So what does that
mean? Well, say you get the chicken pox when you&rsquo;re 4 years old. Your
immune system figures out how to fight it. So you don&rsquo;t get it again. But
if you get measles when you&rsquo;re 5 years old, it could wipe out the memory
of how to beat back the chicken pox. It&rsquo;s like the immune system has
amnesia, Mina says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So parents putting their children into a &ldquo;measles party&rdquo; in order for them
to &ldquo;gain natural immunzation&rdquo; may actually achieve the exact opposite of
that.</p>
