<p>»In the early twentieth century, the Congress of our great
nation debated a glorious plan to resolve the meat shortage in
America. The idea was this: import hippos and raise them in
Louisiana&rsquo;s bayous. The hippos would eat the ruinously invasive
water hyacinth; the American people would eat the hippos;
everyone would go home happy. Well, except the hippo&rsquo;s. They&rsquo;d
go home eaten.«</p>
<p>This plan, on which Congress did not follow through in our
timeline, is the premise and the setting for Sarah Gailey&rsquo;s
alternate universe story &ldquo;River of Teeth&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So we get the sad story of Winslow Remington Houndstooth, a
hippo farmer who lost everything in a fatal fire and now takes
on shady jobs or government work, whatever pays the bills.
Houndstooth is a Hopper, a hippo riding swamp cowboy, and he
just took the job of cleaning a large body of water in the mouth
of the Mississippi from feral, man eating hippos.</p>
<p>He assembles a gang of unlikely companions to help him with
that, but he is up against a shady gangster running a gambling
empire who is not amused of civilisation arriving at all. And of
course there is a traitor in his team.</p>
<p>This is a short read of less than 200 paper-pages, but it&rsquo;s also
not expensive. The premise is completely insane, the characters
are one-of-a-kind, refreshingly non-heroic, and have a lot of
history together - which we discover as we go along.</p>
<p>Good for one evening, but it will be a fun evening.</p>
