<p>Bob is making what he was built for: more Bobs. Bob is in fact a
dead computer programmer back from the destroyed and near
inhabitable Planet Earth, who has been turned into an upload
inhabiting a Von Neumann probe. His mission is to explore
strange new worlds, going where nothing has gone before and make
more of himself.</p>
<p>You can read more of his Genesis in
[We Are Legion]({% link _posts/2017-03-02-fertig-gelesen-we-are-legion-we-are-bob.md %})
Part 1 of the
<a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B073DCB98Y/ref=series_rw_dp_sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bobiverse series</a>

.</p>
<p>This second book in the series plays 40 years later, not that it
matters much in the grand order of things. Bob still has to deal
with the problems that were becoming visible in the first book:
there are still Brasilian space probes out there to get him, he
still has to understand and manage the ecology of the alien
world, where he plays Sky God to a bunch of stone age level
aliens, and he still has to learn more about the mysterious
planet eating aliens he encountered at the end of Book 1.</p>
<p>So this is a story told from the point of view of a computer
with the body of a space ship, yet it is strangely human in a
very compelling way: The nation of Bobs is developing in an
interesting diverse way, the interaction of Bob with the
remainder of The Faith is elegant politics and very human
revenge, there is an actual love story which obviously can end
only on a sad note, and a bunch of other very touching moments.</p>
<p>There are some obvious plot holes or discrepancies, where the
author grossly underestimates the size and amount of resources
in an entire star system - and on the other end a Dyson sphere.</p>
<p>But the book is well written and a fun read.
<a href="https://www.amazon.de/These-Worlds-Bobiverse-Book-English-ebook/dp/B0736185ZL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 3</a>


will come out in a week.</p>
