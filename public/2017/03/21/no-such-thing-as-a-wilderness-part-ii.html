<blockquote>
<p>New research investigating the transition of the Sahara from a lush, green
landscape 10,000 years ago to the arid conditions found today, suggests
that humans may have played an active role in its desertification. [&hellip;]
As more vegetation was removed by the introduction of livestock, it
increased the albedo (the amount of sunlight that reflects off the earth&rsquo;s
surface) of the land, which in turn influenced atmospheric conditions
sufficiently to reduce monsoon rainfall. The weakening monsoons caused
further desertification and vegetation loss, promoting a feedback loop
which eventually spread over the entirety of the modern Sahara.</p>

about current day South Western Australia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Europeans began altering the landscape following settlement of the region
in 1829. Vast areas of eucalypt forest were cleared for crops and pasture.
Cleared land produces less turbulence as storms move across the landscape.
And fewer big trees means less transpiration. The atmosphere is drier, the
storms slip by, with less rain produced. Now global effects mean cold
fronts are passing further south, some missing the continent altogether.
The water table is falling by half a metre a year. If the trend continues,
there are predictions of a 17% drop in agricultural production in future
decades.</p>
