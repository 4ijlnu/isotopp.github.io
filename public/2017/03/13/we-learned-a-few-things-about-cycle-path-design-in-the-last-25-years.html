<p>In any discussion about cycling in Germany, sooner or later some geek who
has been exposed to USENET shows up and then the ADFC #173
(<a href="http://bernd.sluka.de/Radfahren/fdf173.pdf">http://bernd.sluka.de/Radfahren/fdf173.pdf</a>) is being quoted. That&rsquo;s a thing
from 1992.</p>
<p>The usual thing happened <a href="https://www.facebook.com/konni.scheller/posts/601278760077183" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here on Facebook</a>

 - a
discussion about the <a href="http://www.solaroad.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SolaRoad Krommenie</a>

 diverged
into &ldquo;Cycle Paths are stupid&rdquo; and then linked over to the ADFC #173.</p>
<p>Here is a bunch of more recent material and links.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">

</p>

</p>
<p>The TL;DR is: When there is no proper traffic separation or traffic
separation is impossible, then an on-the-road cycle path, is usually better
than a cycle path that runs more or less invisibly by the road and then
suddenly intersects with the road at crossings. But a cycle path on the
road, not separated by traffic has a number of drawbacks - paint is never
enough.</p>
<ul>
<li>It reduces cycling in &ldquo;weak&rdquo; cyclists, very young and older people,
feeling insecure close to cars.</li>
<li>It prevents building wide cycle pathes, and prevents &ldquo;social&rdquo; cycling, that is,
usually two cyclists can&rsquo;t be riding side by side, talking while cycling,
like people in a car would be able to do it.</li>
<li>It comes with speed limits on the car in order to be safe. In the
Netherlands, cycle lanes on roads come with a 30 km/h speed limit
recommended for cars, and a 50 km/h absolute limit.
<ul>
<li>Usually, for 50 km/h a cycle path that is somehow separated from the
road, and
<a href="http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2014/05/the-best-roundabout-design-for-cyclists.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roundabouts</a>


instead of crossings are recommended.</li>
<li>For faster than 50 km/h,
<a href="http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2012/04/100-segregation-of-bikes-and-cars.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unravelling</a>


(intersection free cycle paths) are recommended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A View from the Cycle Path is generally a recommended blog. They have an
article about <a href="http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2014/04/on-road-cycle-lanes-good-bad-and-ugly.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On The Road Cycle Lanes</a>

,
done properly and improperly. The <strong>What&rsquo;s Better</strong> section at the end of
the article discusses better solutions: Separate cycle paths with
<a href="http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2014/05/the-best-roundabout-design-for-cyclists.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roundabouts</a>

,
and
<a href="http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2012/04/100-segregation-of-bikes-and-cars.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unravelling</a>


(completely separate, intersection free infrastructures for different types of traffic). The
<a href="http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/search/label/cycle%20paths" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cycle Paths tag</a>

 in the
blog shows a lot of examples. An
<a href="http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2012/04/100-segregation-of-bikes-and-cars.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article on unravelling</a>


shows intersection free infrastructure. An example for unravelling can be
seen
<a href="https://www.google.nl/maps/dir/Graan&#43;voor&#43;Visch&#43;14402,&#43;Hoofddorp/Hoofddorp,&#43;Station,&#43;2132&#43;HA&#43;Hoofddorp/@52.2929719,4.6950909,210m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x47c5e7a6b423096d:0xc6352d61ad3008ff!2m2!1d4.6914988!2d52.2952505!1m5!1m1!1s0x47c5e70a44c2d41f:0x34a4aa65b173485d!2m2!1d4.6985328!2d52.2927456?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Google Maps close to Hoofddorp Station</a>


and in many other places.</p>

<p>Another article explains
<a href="http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2014/05/the-best-roundabout-design-for-cyclists.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safe roundabouts</a>


for bike lanes crossing road safely at intersections. The keys to the design
are: The cycle path is led in a way that the cyclists are forced to slow
down exactly at the dangerous point, and not before, accelerating into a
danger zone, and the road is led in a way that motorists have to deal only
with one danger at a time, and always into the same direction, right-ahead
(two o&rsquo;clock), and have adequate room to stop and wait.</p>
<p>And, separation of on-the-road cycle paths can be relatively simple and
cheap, as shown by this

are also being discussed in that blog. How did the Netherlands become such a
good country for cycling? It started in the 70ies,

In fact,

in the Netherlands that other countries wish to have, and
