</p>
<p>Every single time a big Silicon Valley company updates their
Terms of Service, there is somebody who mis-interprets the
change as an attempt to landgrab, or take ownership of the
things being uploaded to the service.</p>
<p>This time it affects github.</p>
<p>Their new TOS has a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#d-user-generated-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">section on User-Generated Content</a>

,
which in github&rsquo;s case is all the repositories, snippets and
other stuff they are hosting. In order to do the stuff they are
doing on their users behalf, they need a lot of legal
permissions on the stuff you are sending to them.</p>
<p>That might seem scary, but please stop here and actually read
that section linked up there. It&rsquo;s one of the most clear,
non-legalese TOS I have ever seen and it even explains WHY they
need these rights and what they are going to use them for.</p>
<p>So D.4 says &ldquo;You grant us and our legal successors the right to
store and display your Content and make incidental copies as
necessary to render the Website and provide the Service&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Why is this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That means you&rsquo;re giving us the right to do things like
reproduce your content (so we can do things like copy it to
our database and make backups); display it (so we can do
things like show it to you and other users); modify it (so our
server can do things like parse it into a search index);
distribute it (so we can do things like share it with other
users); and perform it (in case your content is something like
music or video).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they ask for the necessary license to operate, and that
license is non-exclusive (good), time-unlimited (necessary) and
limited (for the purposes as stated (&ldquo;as necessary to render the
Website and provide the Service.&quot;)</p>
<p>Website and Service are upcase, which means they are defined
more clearly further up in document, limiting the license even
more.</p>
<p>D.5 says &ldquo;License Grant to Other Users&rdquo;, and again the TOS
states clearly when (&ldquo;by setting your repositories to be viewed
publicly&rdquo;) and what and WHY again (github is about forking, that
requires a license to do that from you). And again, it&rsquo;s
limited: If you set your repo to public, &ldquo;you grant each User
(upcase!) of GitHub a [&hellip;] license to [&hellip;]&rdquo;. Again, it&rsquo;s
limited - the license is nonexclusive, and for a purpose (&ldquo;to
[&hellip; list of things &hellip;]&quot;). This is about as clear,
non-threatening, transparent and obvious any legal contract you
are going to see in your life can ever get.</p>
<p>So, D.7 is about moral rights (that&rsquo;s a term for authorship
attribution rights that are part of euro-copyright as opposed to
us-copyright). And it says &ldquo;you waive these rights and agree not
to assert them against us&rdquo;, which means, you still have these
rights, but you can&rsquo;t sue github for doing what github is about.
And you again grant a license, limited, for a purpose (&ldquo;render
the Website and provide the Service&rdquo;).</p>
<p>TL;DR: GitHub is a nice company. The TOS change is fine. Calm
down, and STFU until you understand basic copyright law and
contractual language. Thanks.</p>
