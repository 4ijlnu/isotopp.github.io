<!-- s9ymdb:4212 --><img width='180' height='180' style="float: right; border: 0px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;" src="/uploads/bloodsucking_fiends.jpg" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Bloodsucking-Fiends-Christopher-Moore/dp/0060735414/">Bloodsucking Fiends</a>: Gelangweilter 800 Jahre Alter Supervampir beißt irischstämmige amerikanische Versicherungsangestellte mit mangelndem Selbstbewußtsein, die kurz vor ihrer Midlife-Crisis steht - und erschafft ein Monster. Aber Christopher Moore bleibt nicht bei einem Erzählstrang. Gleich Douglas Adams läßt er seine Geschichten in kleine Seiten- und Abseitenlinien laufen, getreu dem Motto: Lieber einen guten Freund verlieren als eine gute Pointe auszulassen. Zur Dekoration klebt er eine Reihe von Filmzitaten und Popkultur-Referenzen mit in die Story rein, einfach weil es zu schade wäre, es nicht zu tun.

Mein Favorit: Die Gefängnisszene. Tommy, Vampir-Jodies neuer Freund oder Ghul, er weiß es nicht so genau, sitzt aus Gründen die hier zu erklären zu weit führen würden, im Knast.


<blockquote>Tommy guessed the temperature in the cell to be about sixty-five, but even so, his cellmate, the six-foot-five, two-hundred-fifty-pound, unshaven, unbathed, one-eyed psychopath with the Disney-character tattoos, was dripping with sweat.
Maybe, Tommy tought, as he cowered in the corner behind the toilet, it's warmer up there on the bunk. Or maybe it's hard work trying to stare at someone menacingly, without blinking, for six hours when you have ony one eye.
"I hate you", said One-Eye.
"Sorry", said Tommy.
One-Eye stood up and flexed his biceps; Micky and Goofy bulged angrily. "Are you making fun of me?"
Tommy didn't want to say anything, so he shook his head violently, trying to make sure that nothing remotely resembling a smile crossed his face.
One-Eye sat down on the bunk and resumed menacing. "What are you in for?"
"Nothing", Tommy said. "I didn't do anything."
"Don't fuck with me, ass-wipe. What were you arrested for?"
Tommy fidgeted, trying to work his way into the cinder-block wall. "Well, I put my girlfriend in the freezer, but I don't think that's a crime."
One-Eye, for the first time he'd been put in the cell, smiled. "Me either. You didn't use an assault weapon, did you?"
"Nope, a Sears frost-free."
"Oh, good; they're really tough on crimes with assault weapons."
"So," Tommy sais, venturing an inch out of the corner, "what are you in for?" Thinking baby-stomping, thinking cannibalism, thinking fast-food massacre.
One-Eye hung his head. "Copyright infringement."
"You're kidding?"
One-Eye frowned. Tommy slid back into his corner, adding, "Really? That's bad."
One-Eye pulled of his ratty T-shirt. The seven dwarfs danced across his massive chest between knife and bullet scars. On his stomach, Show White and Cinderella were locked in a frothy embrace of mutual muffin munching.
"Yeah, I made the mistake of walking around without a shirt. A Disney executive who was up here on vacation saw me down be the wharf. He called their legal pit bulls."
Tommy shook his head in sympathy. "I didn't know they put you in jail for copyright infringement."
"Well, they don't, really. It was when I ripped the guy's shoulder out of their sockets that the police got involved."
"That's not a crime, either, is it?"
One-Eye rubbed his temples as if it was excruciating to remember. "It was in front of his kids."
"Oh," Tommy said.
"Flood, on your feed," a guard said from the cell door. Inspector Nick Cavuto stood behind him.
"C'mon, cutie," Cavuto said. "We're going for a last walk."</blockquote>
