      <description>So Python is a beautiful language, which is also kind of slow. And the more cores you have, the worse it gets, because of the GIL in the most popular implementations. Other languages are much better at concurrency, one of them supposedly being Go. So Geeks at Google have been pondering the problem, and came up with a Python-to-Go compiler called Grumpy.
Read more about it in their blog . In rigged benchmarks it looks awesome, and under real world load it supposedly performs quite well.</description>
