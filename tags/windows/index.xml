      <description>I never wrote this up, and the information online is all referring to older versions of Windows, so let&amp;rsquo;s fix this.
 The MS-DOS version of getting Umlauts on a US keyboard is to type the ASCII codes. As I can&amp;rsquo;t and won&amp;rsquo;t remember these codes, this won&amp;rsquo;t work for me. There is a deadkey way to get a &amp;ldquo;US (International Keyboard)&amp;rdquo;. On these, you type Double Quotes &amp;quot;, and then the letter that should form the Umlaut, for example o, for an รถ.</description>

      <description>So I am a Windows User now. I have an old MacBook pro, Late-2013 13&amp;quot; Retina, i7, 16 GB, 1 TB SSD, and the battery is done now, after 7 years. Also, the hardware is aging, and I want it refurbished and upgrade the son&amp;rsquo;s equipment (which is the previous 2010 MBP I had at that time).
Modern Apple is not my thing. I have a company MBP, 2018 Retina 13&amp;quot; Four-Port, i7, 16 GB, and everything about this device is wrong.</description>
