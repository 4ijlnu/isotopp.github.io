      <description>Evaluating the Changing Causes of Photovoltaics Cost Reduction Why is PV Solar Energy getting cheaper and cheaper?
 We find that increased module efficiency was the leading low-level cause of cost reduction in 1980-2001, contributing almost 30% of the cost decline. The most important high-level mechanism was R&amp;amp;D in these earlier stages of the technology. After 2001, scale economies became a more significant cause of cost reduction, approaching R&amp;amp;D in importance.</description>

      <title>The Story of CO2 (and other Greenhouse Gas Emissions)</title>

      <description>Our World in Data has a very nice long read with many interactive visualisations giving context to CO2.
We begin with exploring CO2 cumulative (how much CO2 did each nation produce over its industrial history), scaling it to annual emission and then scaling it by population, too. We also learn about CO2 produced vs. CO2 in the atmosphere, which is a delayed system.
The second part then deals with CO2 and industrialisation: Emission vs.</description>

      <description>There are things, Lovecraft hypothesizes, that Man is not meant to know. This paper is touching on these subjects: That is not dead which can eternal lie: the aestivation hypothesis for resolving Fermi&amp;rsquo;s paradox.  If a civilization wants to maximize computation it appears rational to aestivate until the far future in order to exploit the low temperature environment: this can produce a 10^30 multiplier of achievable computation. We hence suggest the &amp;ldquo;aestivation hypothesis&amp;rdquo;: the reason we are not observing manifestations of alien civilizations is that they are currently (mostly) inactive, patiently waiting for future cosmic eras.</description>

      <title>The Measles vs your immune system</title>

      <description>NPR has an article about the measles. It is already known that after a measles infection the immune system goes down for a few weeks and followup infections are common. It seems that what the infection does is worse than that. With the introduction of measles vaccination it has been observed that other infections went down within 2-3 years after measles immunization took place. Researchers wanted to know why and found evidence that</description>

      <description>Science Daily writes :
 New research investigating the transition of the Sahara from a lush, green landscape 10,000 years ago to the arid conditions found today, suggests that humans may have played an active role in its desertification. [&amp;hellip;] As more vegetation was removed by the introduction of livestock, it increased the albedo (the amount of sunlight that reflects off the earth&amp;rsquo;s surface) of the land, which in turn influenced atmospheric conditions sufficiently to reduce monsoon rainfall.</description>

      <description>Some 40 authors are listed in the title of Persistent effects of pre-Columbian plant domestication on Amazonian forest composition in Science.
The TL;DR is: The Amazonas Rain Forest is a 10.000 year old garden, which has been left untended for the last 500 years after the Amerindian genocide of European conquistadors.
 The extent to which pre-Columbian societies altered Amazonian landscapes is hotly debated. We performed a basin-wide analysis of pre-Columbian impacts on Amazonian forests by overlaying known archaeological sites in Amazonia with the distributions and abundances of 85 woody species domesticated by pre-Columbian peoples.</description>

      <description>Salted Doorknobs kill MRSA Says this article at The Atlantic :
 Superbugs like Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, have wreaked havoc on the health-care system in recent years. [&amp;hellip;] How do you stop them? Frequent hand washing is one option, but that requires a behavior change, which can be difficult, even for hospital staff. Another option is to coat those frequently fondled objects most likely to carry the bugs—doorknobs, bed rails, toilet handles—with a special anti-microbial surface, like copper.</description>

      <description>So Saturn has a &amp;lsquo;moon&amp;rsquo;. At least that&amp;rsquo;s what They want us to believe. But we know better.
 Supposedly Pan , a Saturn Moon, as seen by Cassini.

      <title>Video: 20 Years of continuous improvement in crash safety</title>
      <link>/2017/02/09/video-20-years-of-continuous-improvement-in-crash-safety.html</link>

      <description>Continual improvement is sometimes hard to see, because each iteration, each incremental step itself is tiny so that the actual change escapes our attention. Also, just living our lives, our time sense is sometimes distorted. Me for example, I was almost 30 already in the late Nineties, and while that is already 20 years ago, it feels like yesterday to me. So car safety in the Nineties, compared to now? It was crap.</description>

      <description>Lidar Image
Two articles about the Maya civilization: Seeker article about LiDAR being used to reveal ancient structures on the Jungle ground: A network of 150km of prehistoric Autobahn ran through the Jungle, binding the Mayan Empire together.
 &amp;ldquo;These causeways are 130 feet wide, up to 20 feet high and in some cases they extend as far as 25 miles,&amp;rdquo; Hansen said.
 A causeway is a raised road across difficult, often wet or unstable ground.</description>

      <description>Anscombe&amp;rsquo;s Quartet by Schutz
Unlearning Descriptive Statistics explains many things you should know about working with Numbers that your Statistics Class in University probably did not explain properly. If they did, maybe Graphite would not hurt so much, with all the Averaging going on where it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t, and maybe Gill Tene would not have had to give talks like How NOT to measure latency (which is awesome, by the way and if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen this talk, do it right now).</description>

      <description>Why is our galaxy moving through space, and into which directions is everything else moving?
Scientists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have been mapping these forces, and found a very empty region in space that seems to push a lot of galaxies away from it, as well as a (previously known) region thats attracting them.
The result looks like a billion light year magnet:
 The dipole repeller What causes these forces is as of now not well understood.</description>

      <description>Coming up: Chinese New Year on 28. January. The coming year is a year of the Fire Rooster , and apparently these things mean a lot to a lot of people. So what influence does the Chinese Zodiac have? Well, one sign that is supposed to be very unlucky is the Fire Horse. An article from 2012 explains:
 People born during the year of the Fire Horse are notorious for being bad luck.</description>
