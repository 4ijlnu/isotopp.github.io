      <description>An older talk from 2 years ago, which for some reason I was not able to find in the blog.
For reasons that do not need exploration at this junction I had to explain Processes and Process Maturity some time ago, and a colleague asked me to put my thinking into a talk. So this is going to be boring, because you are likely to know most of this already, but on the other hand, it is good to be on the same page when it comes to models and vocabulary.</description>
