      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not my fault, really. It&amp;rsquo;s Schenker , and Urban Games . They sent me my Nvidia 1070 (with a side of CPU and Memory), and now there is a Windows Shoebox (well, Clown Shoe sized showbox) somewhere in our home, and Steam Streaming is busy. I&amp;rsquo;m off laying tracks with the family, now the screen updates are not jumpy any more.

      <description>The Telegraph had a article on a self-styled &amp;lsquo;grammar vigilante&amp;rsquo;, who corrects badly punctuated shop signs in the dead of the night, and the article has not been dated April, 1st.
 […] the man has corrected tens of missing and misplaced apostrophes on shop banners across Bristol over the past 13 years. The pedant, who is yet to reveal his identity, claims his efforts are needed to bring an end to the improper use of English.</description>

      <title>How does the 8008 processor work?</title>
      <link>/2017/03/15/how-does-the-8008-processor-work.html</link>

      <guid>/2017/03/15/how-does-the-8008-processor-work.html</guid>
      <description>The historic 8008 processor is 45 years old: It was released on the 13th of March 1972. Ken Shirriff has a blog post that explains features of the CPU, from a die photo.
Compared to modern CPUs, the 8008 is weird in multiple ways: The storage for the stack is on chip instead of in memory, and it is not accessed in linear order for weird transistor saving reasons. Things have changed since then a lot, but back then, a central processing unit was usually not a single die, but a bunch of discrete electronics on a board.</description>

      <description>So Saturn has a &amp;lsquo;moon&amp;rsquo;. At least that&amp;rsquo;s what They want us to believe. But we know better.
 Supposedly Pan , a Saturn Moon, as seen by Cassini.

      <title>IRC so: 110 Freedom Volts</title>

      <description>Work Chat said: [On boiling water with Gas instead of an electric cooker]
L&amp;gt; Yeah, they have 110 freedom volts. Or whatever weird unit they use for that.
I&amp;gt; So what is the imperial unit for Volt?
 Let&amp;rsquo;s see. Volt in SI units :
 That gives us $$ 1V = 1 kg * m^2 * s^{-3} * A^{-1}. $$
We can turn the kg into pounds and the square meters into square feet, but we can&amp;rsquo;t easily imperialize the seconds and Amperes.</description>

      <title>Bielefeld Conspiracy hits Facebook</title>
      <link>/2017/01/26/bielefeld-conspiracy-hits-facebook.html</link>

      <guid>/2017/01/26/bielefeld-conspiracy-hits-facebook.html</guid>
      <description>Westfalenblatt knows:
 Yesterday all references to the place name &amp;ldquo;Bielefeld&amp;rdquo; have been replaced with &amp;ldquo;Bielefeldverschwörung &amp;rdquo; (Bielefeld Conspiracy):
 Facebook showing &amp;ldquo;Bielefeldverschwörung&amp;rdquo; (Bielefeld Conspiracy) instead of the proper city name.
Bielefeld is a typical while label city in Germany. In fact, it is conspiciously inconspicious, and that is, so the conspiracy theory fabricated by Achim Held in 1993, because the city does not actually exist. It&amp;rsquo;s a fake location that protects something else on the map, probably an entrance to the Hollow Earth or something else, but we don&amp;rsquo;t actually know.</description>

      <description>Coming up: Chinese New Year on 28. January. The coming year is a year of the Fire Rooster , and apparently these things mean a lot to a lot of people. So what influence does the Chinese Zodiac have? Well, one sign that is supposed to be very unlucky is the Fire Horse. An article from 2012 explains:
 People born during the year of the Fire Horse are notorious for being bad luck.</description>
