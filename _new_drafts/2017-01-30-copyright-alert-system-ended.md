<p> ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BVWD_FBI_Warning_Screen_6a-300x224.jpg) An article in Variety on the failed "Copyright Alert System": "[Internet Service Providers, Studios and Record Labels Call It Quits on Copyright Alert System](http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/copyright-alerts-piracy-mpaa-comcast-att-1201971756/)". "Copyright Alerty System" is the name of the US "three strikes" implementation, "in which consumers received “copyright alerts” when they viewed peer-to-peer pirated content". The system apparently does not work the way the MPAA intended - especially the repeat offenders are not being deterred by the warning mails they receive, and ISPs are not terminating contracts of said repeat offenders due to fear of liability lawsuits. Also, the system works on P2P file shared content only, and this is no longer a relevant distribution mechanism.</p>
