<p>[Bicycle Dutch](https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2017/05/16/king-to-open-velo-city-and-other-news/) has a selection of news: Velo-City &nbsp;is a conference on June, 13 in Nijmegen, NL. Because he's not flying for KLM on that day, Willem-Alexander will open the conference. Also, the Dutch View on cycling helmets: </p>
<p>> Take the bicycle helmet. If you make it mandatory, you strengthen the idea that the bike is a dangerous means of transport. That leads to a decrease in the number of cyclists. That again decreases the safety, because the more cyclists there are, the more other road users will consider them. In short: the bicycle helmet increases the individual safety, but decreases the safety in general.</p>
<p> I have yet to see Dutch people riding their bikes with helmets on.</p>
