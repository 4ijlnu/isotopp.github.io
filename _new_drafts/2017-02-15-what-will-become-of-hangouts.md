<p>Last year in August we got the news that Google is hating us all. And by that I do not just mean the new and "improved" Google plus sans Hangout integration and Search, but also [their announcement to kill Chrome Apps](http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/19/12555052/google-shutting-down-chrome-apps) for no reason at all instead of fixing the independent restart and focus problems. For Hangouts, that means we are left with [hangouts.google.com](https://hangouts.google.com). Which looks half Material Design and Half Gmail-Retro-Industrial. Also, the chat window is narrow, cannot be resized, and generally manages to transmit the vibe that Google has fired all UX and UI designers they never managed to talk to in the first place. You can reach me on WhatsApp. ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-15-at-09.50.06.png)</p>
