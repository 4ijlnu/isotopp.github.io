<p>Motherboard about the [NASA twin study](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/scott-kelly-mark-kelly-twins-study-nasa-genes):</p>
<p>> [The twin brothers Mark and Scott Kelly]&nbsp;were closely studied by ten different research teams at various points, including before, during, and after Scott Kelly's 340-day-stint living on the International Space Station. Mark Kelly, who has flown in space previously, although never for such a long period of time, acted as the control subject on Earth.</p>
<p> It seems that a long time in Space has many effects on human biology, not all of them bad - telomeres seem to get longer.</p>
