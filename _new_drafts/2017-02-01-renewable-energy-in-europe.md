<p>The European Comission&nbsp;just [released a press release](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-17-163_en.htm) that shows and explains the use of renewable energy in Europe.</p>
<p>> Having achieved a share of 16% renewables in its final energy consumption in 2014 and an estimated share of close to 16.4% in 2015 **, the EU as a whole is well on track to reach its 20% target by 2020.** However, Member States will have to keep up their efforts in order to reach their national goals.</p>
