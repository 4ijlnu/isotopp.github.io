<p>Technology Review has [an article](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602468/the-one-and-only-texas-wind-boom/) about wind power in Texas.</p>
<p>> With nearly 18,000 megawatts of capacity, Texas, if it were a country, would be the sixth-largest generator of wind power in the world, right behind Spain.</p>
<p> Texas profits from an electric power network built in 2007, whose purpose is to bring wind power generated in the desolate west and north parts of the state to the big cities in the south and east.</p>
