<p>The European Radio Equipment Directive requires all devices that are able to send and receive radio signals to be locked down. Without further specification of exceptions, which has not yet been done, this will affect all devices, including pure receivers such as GPS receivers and car radios, but also mobile phones and amateur radio operators and of course almost all Internet of Trash (IoT) devices. Hardware manufacturers are required to "install technical measurements to protect the devices from being flashed with 'non-compliant software'". The talk by Max Mehl is [available on the FOSDEM site](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/radio_lockdown_directive/).</p>
