I\> [https://twitter.com/RedHatPartners/status/877483272061800448](https://twitter.com/RedHatPartners/status/877483272061800448) I\> A: "Strong and Stable" ! A\> I: Nee. "Stronger Together" was Rodham-Clinton. A\> Not that this makes it any better. A\> Is Trumpix a thing? A\> Making Linux Great Again! A\> We're gonna have the best Linux. With many Apps. Great apps. And we're gonna kick Poettering out. No more systemd. Linux first! A\> And we're gonna have a great firewall. DENY ONLY! And we're gonna make the cybercriminals pay for it. A\> When Redhat send's their init-systems, they are not sending the best. They are not sending openrc, they are not sending sysv. They are sending systemds that have lots of problems, and they are bringing those problems with them. They are bringing Segfaults. They are bringing CVEs. They are terrible. And some, I assume, are okay...</p>
