<p>([Context](https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-07-24/germany-s-carmakers-are-their-own-worst-enemies) for the tweet below in an article from Bloomberg about the VW/BMW/Mercedes cartel) "Sometimes it is fun to cut out newspaper articles and keep them" &nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;([Tweet](https://twitter.com/tgrdebate/status/889462175831654401)) "Lusting for a scandal, some want to write the downfall of Volkswagen. Others put the entire german industry under suspicion. But they don't even have proof for the German Gangsta AG. [â€¦] The moralising accusation, all German Car Makers would cheat, harming the environment, their customers, the government and the public with their made-up exhaust measurements, is just an unsubstantiated claim. There is no proof. On the other hand, there is a promise without limits by BMW, Mercedes and others: Their cars will run within the limits without software trickery. Why do some claim large scale cheating here?" &nbsp;&nbsp;-- Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 16-Oct-2015, Title Page <!--more--> https://twitter.com/tgrdebate/status/889462175831654401</p>
