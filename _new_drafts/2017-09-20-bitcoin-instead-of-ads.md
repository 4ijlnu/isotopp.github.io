<p>[caption id="attachment\_2609" align="aligncenter" width="640"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/satw-mining-640x219.jpg)](https://satwcomic.com) [Scandinavia and the World](https://satwcomic.com)[/caption] If Web Pages are using Bitcoin mining Javascript instead of advertising, it means Adblockers are winning. Of course it won't work even if it worked, but one can try. That is, as expected uBO is blocking the SATW miner by default by blacklisting the external JS domain with the mining plugin. If it didn't, it would still be too inefficient to actually generate profit, because these days you would need dedicated mining rigs for this. And of course, if that even worked, then you have Bitcoin and not money. So mostly this is a demonstration about how Ads do not work any more. At all. Ever again.</p>
