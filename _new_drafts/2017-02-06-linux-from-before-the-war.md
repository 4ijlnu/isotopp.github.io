<p>[Seth Kenlon from RedHat](https://opensource.com/article/16/12/yearbook-linux-test-driving-distros) has been finding old Linux distros from before the war and installed them. How bad&nbsp;is this old shit, from todays POV? Slackware 1.01 (1993): It does not even have package management. But: </p>
<p>> Over all, Slackware 1.01 feels a lot like a fairly modern UNIX—or more appropriately, it feels like modern UNIX might feel to a Linux user. Most everything is familiar, but there are differences here and there. Not nearly as much a difference as you might expect from an operating system released in 1993!</p>
<p> And it continues like that - much of the old stuff works and feels a lot like stuff today. So besides systemd, there has hardly been any progress at all. For example, some people's desktop looks like this, even today: [caption id="attachment\_496" align="alignleft" width="801"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/suse5fvwm.png)](https://opensource.com/article/16/12/yearbook-linux-test-driving-distros) SUSE 5.1 (1998) - I know people how are using a desktop that looks like this, even today.[/caption]</p>
