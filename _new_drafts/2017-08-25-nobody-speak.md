<p>> A music video for "Nobody Speak" was released on August 24, 2016. The video, which has been described as "brutal [and] politically charged", features political representatives in a meeting. The leaders of the groups begin a rap battle against each other, which after around 90 seconds turns into an all-out brawl involving virtually everyone in the meeting room. The video finishes with one leader preparing to impale his counterpart with an American flag. The leaders of the groups are played by Igor Tsyshkevych and Ian Bailey. Shadow commented on the video, saying that they wanted to make a "positive, life-affirming video that captures politicians at their election-year best. We got this instead." Killer Mike also commented on the video, saying that "It's such a dope video ... it's what I really wish Trump and Hillary would just do and get it over with."</p>
