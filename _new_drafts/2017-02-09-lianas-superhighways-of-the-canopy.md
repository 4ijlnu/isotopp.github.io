<p> ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/jungle-150x150.jpg) [The Atlantic reports](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/02/each-tree-is-an-island/515583/) research on the size of ant populations living in the treetops of forests in Panama. These treetops function as islands, if the tree in question has no vines connecting it to other trees nearby, with the size and diversity of the population being proportional to the tree size. This changes as soon as the canopy is interconnected by lianas, which function as superhighways in the sky, connecting the various treetops into one single environment.</p>
