<p>Inequality is on the rise, the middle class does no longer exist, [finds Market Watch](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/income-share-of-bottom-50-is-collapsing-finds-researchers-including-piketty-2017-02-07). [![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MW-FF304_bottom_20170207112840_MG-300x210.jpg)](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/income-share-of-bottom-50-is-collapsing-finds-researchers-including-piketty-2017-02-07) Actual paper at the [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23119) (TLS Warning: Weak Signature Algorithm).<!--more--></p>
<p>> This paper presents new findings on global inequality dynamics from the World Wealth and Income Database (WID.world), with particular emphasis on the contrast between the trends observed in the United States, China, France, and the United Kingdom. We observe rising top income and wealth shares in nearly all countries in recent decades. But the magnitude of the increase varies substantially, thereby suggesting that different country-specific policies and institutions matter considerably. Long-run wealth inequality dynamics appear to be highly unstable. We stress the need for more democratic transparency on income and wealth dynamics and better access to administrative and financial data.</p>
