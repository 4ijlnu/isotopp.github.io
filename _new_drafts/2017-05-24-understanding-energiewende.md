<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/energiewende.png)](http://www.nationalobserver.com/2017/05/23/news/step-one-get-fossil-fuel-money-out-politics-german-analyst-tells-ottawa)[Arne Jungjohann has been speaking](http://www.nationalobserver.com/2017/05/23/news/step-one-get-fossil-fuel-money-out-politics-german-analyst-tells-ottawa) about the German Energiewende at a&nbsp;[Clean Energy Discussion](https://www.facebook.com/nationalobserver/videos/1729860510363385/) in Ottawa last week. </p>
<p>> Jungjohann offered “lessons" from the German clean energy story, also called the Energiewende. It’s the German word for the country’s clean energy transition, and Jungjohann co-wrote a book about it: Energy Democracy — Germany’s Energiewende to Renewables. [...] It's a technical transition from fossil fuel-based energy to renewable energy, he explained, but it's also a political and cultural transition; it's a transition from centralized, corporation-dominated energy, to a smaller, decentralized power grid.</p>
