<p>Apparently [CBS and The CW are about to reboot "Dynasty"](http://deadline.com/2017/06/dynasty-netflix-international-distribution-rights-the-cw-drama-global-launch-1202118871/) (ran as "Denver-Clan" on German TV). I'd rather see a reboot of [Dallas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_(1978_TV_series)) 2025, in which the oil industry in Texas is in a deep crisis and [the Ewings have to deal with the aftershocks of the Energiewende](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-06-20/texas-is-too-windy-and-sunny-for-old-energy-companies-to-make-money).</p>
