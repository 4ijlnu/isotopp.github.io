<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N02-WhQU-jU Did you know that there are multiple Pyramids in the Netherlands? <!--more--> I am living next to one: [![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_3810.CR2_-640x427.jpg)](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_3810.CR2_.jpg) and there is another one near Utrecht as shown in the video above. Their origin is unclear, they are likely old cult sites where the natives have been&nbsp;bringing human sacrifices to their dark gods, e.g. to keep [Dagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagon_in_popular_culture) at bay.</p>
