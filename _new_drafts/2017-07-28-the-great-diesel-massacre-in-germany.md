<p>It's going to be a Post-Diesel Society in Germany, quickly: Drive reports on the sales ban for the Porsche Cayenne. Porsche is kind of the fall guy here - not many of these cars are being sold, but the engine is actually an Audi one. [Drive](http://www.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/germany-bans-sale-of-porsche-cayenne-diesel-64804.html) (and many others) report:</p>
<p>> Germany's federal motor transport authority, the KBA (Kraftfahrtbundesamt), has placed a registration ban on the Porsche Cayenne&nbsp;Diesel due to the discovery of what it describes as suspect emission manipulation software.</p>
<p><!--more-->If this were to be applied with any consequence, it would also have to affect cars sold in higher volume, up to and including many Golf Diesel and others. Not going to happen, elections are coming up. Meanwhile, many cities are enacting bans on Diesel cars for the inner city limits, because NOx limits are not met. Even Daimler-City Stuttgart ([Article in german](http://www.n-tv.de/wirtschaft/Gericht-urteilt-pro-Diesel-Fahrverbot-in-Stuttgart-article19958098.html)): </p>
<p>> Stuttgart gilt deutschlandweit als "Hauptstadt der Luftverschmutzung". Um Fahrverbote f체r Diesel zu erreichen, reicht die Deutsche Umwelthilfe Klage gegen das Land Baden-W체rttemberg ein. Das Verwaltungsgericht gibt dem Kl채ger nun recht.</p>
<p> The Eco NGO Deutsche Umwelthilfe has sued the county of Baden-W체rttemberg, and won. Starting 1. January 2018 there has to be a ban on Diesel cars entering the inner city of Stuttgart. Similar lawsuits by DUH have been successful in other german cities.</p>
