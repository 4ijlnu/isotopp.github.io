<p>In order to move customers from a "purchase a license" to a subscription model, AgileBits is experimenting with dropping support for local vaults, requiring cloud storage of passwords. There is a lot of [blowback](https://blog.goodstuff.im/dont_use_1password)&nbsp;in Blogs and the 1Password support forums. Also, the security professionals on Twitter frown on this, quite a bit ([Thread](https://mobile.twitter.com/kennwhite/status/884215903109476352)). Discussion on Facebook pointed to Enpass, and that is actually looking like a pretty good 1Password clone.

Enpass is free, but closed source. An independent security audit is planned for the upcoming 6.x release.</p>
