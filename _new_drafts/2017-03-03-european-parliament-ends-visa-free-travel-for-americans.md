<p>[The Independent reports](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/europe-visa-free-travel-americans-european-parliament-vote-a7609406.html): </p>
<p>> The [European Parliament](http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/EuropeanParliament) has voted to end visa-free travel for Americans within the EU. It comes after the US failed to agree visa-free travel for citizens of five EU countries – Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Poland and Romania – as part of a reciprocity agreement. US citizens can normally travel to all countries in the bloc without a visa.</p>
<p> The ban, if it comes, affects all Americas, not just Redneckistanis. Will it come? It depends: </p>
<p>> Following the committee’s vote, the Commission must act to suspend the visa waiver for Americans, but the European Parliament or the Council of the European Union may object.</p>
