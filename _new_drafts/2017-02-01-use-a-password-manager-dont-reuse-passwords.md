<p>> Friend: \<url\> Kris: You said? Has somebody pwned your Skype? Friend: That's what happened. Skype is now Item 125 in 1Password.</p>

<p>> Kris: Very good. Oh man, you are by far not the first contact of mine having this experience. Friend: Last year I spent a weekend to 1Password almost everything and delete old, unused accounts. Thankfully I have a complete archive of all my mail. Friend: In 2008 I suspended my Facebook. That woke up again last summer. Spooky. Thankfully you can delete them completely by now.</p>
<p> If you are not using different passwords for all your accounts, change that now. A password manager can help you quite a bit with that. Using that, you will be using generated passwords, different passwords for each account and you get a password audit.

Don't re-use passwords. Use random, long passwords. Use a password manager. Clean up your password managers security audit. Complain about passwords restrictions. I am looking at you, Berliner Sparkasse.</p>
