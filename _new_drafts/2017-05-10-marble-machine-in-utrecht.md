<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkAwf3hlHSE Utrecht has a museum for music machines, [Speelklok Museum](https://goo.gl/maps/jRkxcEjYnXJ2). [Wintergatan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q) built a real-world [Animusic Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyCIpKAIFyo). That machine was retired, [disassembled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoYmoCUvGqM)&nbsp;and will now be available in the [Speelklock Museum](https://www.museumspeelklok.nl/zien-doen/agenda-nieuws/meet-greet-tour-martin-molin-en-marble-machine/) in Utrecht end of May. More Info:<!--more--></p>
<p>> We will arrange three special guided tours of the museum on Sunday may 28:th, 11.00, 13.00 and 15.00 with a guide from the museum and myself.&nbsp;The Guide from Speelklok will show the highlights of the museums collection and I&nbsp;will talk about the instruments at Speelklok that inspired me to build the Marble Machine. If you are interested in taking part of these tours send an email to: info@museumspelklok.nl State which time you want to come and how many persons, 40 places per tour and the normal entrance fee for the museum, â‚¬12 apply.</p>
<p> and it might be more interesting to come earlier, because </p>
<p>> You can also come and see me struggling to get the unnumbered pieces together between Tuesday 23:rd of may and Saturday 27:h of May. During this period the museum have normal opening hours and i will be there to assemble the machine. Not sure about exact times though.</p>
