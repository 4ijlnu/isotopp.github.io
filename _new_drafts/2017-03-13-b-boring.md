<p>Some time ago, I gave a talk about [boring technology at&nbsp;Booking](https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/isotopp/boring-dot-com-the-virtues-of-boring-technology), which means choosing the simplest, stable and maintainable solution you can get away with for solving a problem at a given scale. Apparently Dan McKinley has similar views, which he explained in [Choose Boring Technology](http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology). The writeup explains nicely what boring technology is, and why to prefer this. Never forget your mission, which is business, not technology. The technology is a necessary tool, but likely [not your friend](https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/isotopp/be-simple-be-boring-be-obvious).</p>
