That was 2017, though.[/caption] I just had a discussion about a bunch of people [getting excited](https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-rcs-chat-plans-are-actually-kind-brilliant) about "Chat", Googles new upcoming Chat client based on [Joyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services). And we listed Talk, Hangouts, Allo and Duo, as well as Spaces and Wave as being interactive chat-like things that nobody uses. Joyn is based on a standard from 2008, initiated by the late Nokia. It's currently on it's fifth major revision and has zero adoption, zero encryption and an intransparent cost - it's implemented by each telco, with each telco providing it's own implementation and gateways, and cost model, which may be charging only for the bytes, or like SMS for each message element. Also, each telcos message server intercepts all messages in the clear, by design. Anyway, speaking about Spaces, I checked the site and learned that it was shut down on April, 17th. 2017. One year ago. Literally nobody noticed.</p>
