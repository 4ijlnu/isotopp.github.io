<p>[caption id="attachment\_1507" align="aligncenter" width="1170"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/meaningless.png)](http://blog.koehntopp.info/index.php/1506-meaningless-content/meaningless/) This blog has been officially classified as "Meaningless content"[/caption] <!--more-->This screenshot has been made my somebody else, and been shared with me. My employer does not use such content filters, and that is a good thingâ„¢. Still, since&nbsp;2014 I have been completely separating private and work hardware. There is no work stuff on my private phone any more, and it is not using the corporate Wifi. I have no private stuff on my work computer any more, and no work stuff on my private computer. The blog is handled from the private machine, as is all private web browsing. I have a VNC session in a ssh tunnel to my home computer from work, for private stuff that happens during work time. Keeping things separated, hard, helps a lot to keep things clear.</p>
