<p>Washington Post on "[Brexit and Britain's delusions of empire](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/31/brexit-and-britains-delusions-of-empire/)": The article goes through the former British colonies and checks how much they need the British and their trade to succeed. TL;DR: They don't. The Guardian on "[Up to 100,000 UK jobs at risk as Merkel and Juncker ally warns on euro clearing](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/04/uk-jobs-merkel-juncker-euro-clearing-eu-manfred-weber-brexit)":</p>
<p>> “EU citizens decide on their own money,” Weber said during a press conference in Strasbourg on Tuesday. “When the UK is leaving the European Union it is not thinkable that at the end the whole euro business is managed in London. This is an external place, this is not an EU place any more. The euro business should be managed on EU soil.” […] Clearing houses are independent parties that sit between the two parties in a trade and are tasked with managing the risk if one side defaults on payment. London clears around three-quarters of all euro-denominated trades.</p>
<p> And German Die Zeit has an article titled simply "[Vergesst Großbritannien!](http://www.zeit.de/2017/15/europaeische-union-brexit-peter-mandelson-grossbritannien)" ("Forget Britain!"), an interview with Labour-Politician and EU Trade Commissar Perer Mandelson. &nbsp;</p>
