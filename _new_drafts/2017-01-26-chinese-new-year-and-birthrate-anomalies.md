The coming year is a [year of the Fire Rooster](http://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/chinese-zodiac/rooster.htm), and apparently these things mean a lot to a lot of people. So what influence does the Chinese Zodiac have? Well, one sign that is supposed to be very unlucky is the Fire Horse. An [article from 2012](https://www.tofugu.com/japan/fire-horse-zodiac/) explains: </p>
<p>> People born during the year of the Fire Horse are notorious for being bad luck. People born during a Fire Horse years are said to be irresponsible, rebellious, and overall bad news. And for some reason, women are said to be especially dangerous Fire Horses. They supposedly sap their familyâ€™s finances, neglect their children, and drive their father and husband to an early grave.</p>
<p> Solution? Don't make babies in a Fire Horse year, and especially no female babies. So 1966 was a Fire Horse, and that's what 1966 stats look like: ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/japan-birthrate-graph.png) &nbsp;</p>
