<p>[caption id="attachment\_2716" align="alignleft" width="194"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/as-on-the-job-194x300.jpg)](Asperger's on the Job) [Asperger's on the Job](https://www.amazon.de/Aspergers-Job-Must-Have-Functioning-Employers-ebook/dp/B00TZN9OF0)[/caption] These weird people with headphones on, working strange hours, not wanting to stand in front of the group in Standups and for talks - what are they, where to they come from and how do you handle them at work? The book is structured as a self-help book, assessing various aspects of [Asperger Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome), how they manifest and what that might mean in the workplace. It also discusses personal and environmental mitigations. Each chapter concludes with a list of things that the Aspie and their employer could do, and leaves a number of questions that can help to develop a personal or environmental programme. Useful for people that live with a geek population, where the number of Aspies is supposedly higher than average, and for geek herders as well. Fast read, but not everything is useful. Still worthwhile. "[Asperger's on the Job](https://www.amazon.de/Aspergers-Job-Must-Have-Functioning-Employers-ebook/dp/B00TZN9OF0)", Rudy Simone, EUR 13.45</p>
