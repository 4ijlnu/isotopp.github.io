<p>So Google fucked the Nexus line, and did the lackluster and overpriced Pixel excursion. The guy who strategically fucked this up, David Foster, apparently [goes back to Amazon](https://www.xda-developers.com/david-foster-leaves-google-to-go-back-to-work-at-amazon/). Meanwhile it is an [open secret](https://9to5mac.com/2017/04/27/more-detailed-alleged-iphone-8-schematic-surfaces-suggests-wireless-charging-will-be-based-on-qi-tech/) that the iPhone 8 will have the Qi charging that the current Nexus and Pixels don't have any more. Also, Otterbox and friends are already [making contactless battery extensions](https://9to5mac.com/2017/04/27/review-mophies-wireless-charging-battery-comes-to-otterboxs-universe-case-system/). It's not pretty and it's not efficient, but after the "no ports for nobody" disaster of the current generation of Macbook Pros it's at least consistent. This leaves us with the question: Will Google make attractive phones again after Foster is gone now?</p>
