<p>I am the last person on this planet to find [Höme Improvisåtion](http://store.steampowered.com/app/357670/Home_Improvisation_Furniture_Sandbox/), a sandbox game that is totally not affiliated with IKEA at all. [![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bildschirmfoto-2017-04-28-um-21.07.32-1024x646.png)](http://store.steampowered.com/app/357670/Home_Improvisation_Furniture_Sandbox/) What you get is an unlimited supply of things in flatpacks, zero instructions, insufficient controls (maybe it's better in VR), and all things connect to each other, even between unrelated flatpacks. So basically it's not Lego and not IKEA, either. You can build whatever the game wants you to build, or get more flatpacks and mix and match. Some of them have motors, muhahaha.</p>
