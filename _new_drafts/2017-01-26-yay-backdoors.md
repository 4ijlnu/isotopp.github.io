<p>[The EFF reminds us](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/01/attorney-general-nominee-sessions-backs-crypto-backdoors) that the general direction of current US politics is full steam backwards, and damn the torpedoes. Trump’s nominee for Attorney General, Sen. Jeff Sessions said on the topic of encryption backdoors </p>
<p>> Encryption serves many valuable and important purposes. **It is also critical, however, that national security and criminal investigators be able to overcome encryption** , under lawful authority, when necessary to the furtherance of national-security and criminal investigations.</p>
<p>The EFF comments:</p>
<p>> Despite Sessions’ “on the one hand, on the other” phrasing, this answer is a clear endorsement of backdooring the security we all rely on. It’s [simply not feasible](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/97690) for encryption to serve what Sessions concedes are its “many valuable and important purposes” and still be “overcome” when the government wants access to plaintext.</p>
<p>So we are set to repeat the discussions from the crypto wars 25 years ago all over again. Math does not change, and the realities of key management aren't, either.</p>
