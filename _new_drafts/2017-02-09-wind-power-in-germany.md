<p>[caption id="attachment\_617" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/windpower-1024x144.jpg) Windpower at the German North Sea Coast[/caption] Heise [Telepolis is reporting on Wind Power](https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Windkraft-Die-letzten-fetten-Jahre-3619790.html) in Germany. There is a trend to larger and higher turbines. New turbines are rated on the average at 2.85MW, replacing equipment rated on the average around 1MW, and additional capacity is still being installed. Variability is a problem, and 2016 was a bad year for wind power - 1534 "full power hours" (total power produced divided by total capacity installed, a full power year has 8750 hours) compared to almost 2000 full power hours in 2015.<!--more--> New rules, especially in the wind power hostile southern counties of Germany, make new builds complicated or even impossible. New installations are around 140m high in Bavaria, and distance rules require 10x the height of the installation as a minimum distance to the next human housing - that's 1.5km distance, hard to achieve in a country as densely populated as Germany. New build rules are becoming even more complicated and limited after 2019, when there is a limit on buildout of renewable power.</p>
