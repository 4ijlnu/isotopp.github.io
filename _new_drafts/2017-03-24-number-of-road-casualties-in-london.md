<p>The Guardian had in 2010 an article about road casualties in London:</p>
<p>> There you will find that the fall of 299 brought the annual total down from 3,526 killed or seriously injured on London's roads in 2008 to 3,227 in 2009. That's an eight percent fall, which is pretty significant statistically. However, in human terms, the fact that well over 3,000 people were killed or seriously injured in both 2008 and 2009 seems rather more significant. That's nine or ten a day,&nbsp;including 204 people killed in 2008 and 184 in 2009.</p>
<p> We still consider such numbers normal loss of live.</p>
