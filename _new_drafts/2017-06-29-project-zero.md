<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/zer_google_project_zero-150x150.jpg)](http://fortune.com/2017/06/23/google-project-zero-hacker-swat-team/) Fortune has [a kind of home story](http://fortune.com/2017/06/23/google-project-zero-hacker-swat-team/) on [Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.nl/), explaining what it is, how it came to be and who the people in there are. If you do not know what Project Zero is and why it is important, it's a good starting point. If you know about Project Zero, it's still a fun read because of all the parentheses that read »x declined to be interviewed for this story.«</p>
