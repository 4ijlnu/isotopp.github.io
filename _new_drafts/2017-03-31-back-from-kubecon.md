<p>Right on the heels of the Openshift Commons and co-located with them, [Kubecon 2017](https://cloudnativeeu2017.sched.com/) happened at the BCC in Berlin. Supposedly 1500 people attended, which was straining BCC's&nbsp;capacity to the limit, especially [on the A-level](http://www.bcc-berlin.de/de/ebene-a). Room A03, which hosted the "Deep Dive track" was continuously overcrowded and could not accommodate all interested people. Also, this was the most noisy event I have been attending in a long time, especially in the vendor booth setup in [B01/B02](http://www.bcc-berlin.de/de/ebene-b). On the other hand, the hallway track was exceptionally useful, especially if one escaped out the door, weather permitting, or upstairs. Quite a bit of&nbsp;content was a duplicate from the Openshift Commons Gathering preceding the Kubecon, but the inclusion of rkt and containerd as CNCF projects have been news and are very welcome. Especially rkt will be useful, as Docker is not doing very many useful things in the context of Kubernetes and rkt kind of restricts itself to doing only these useful things and not having any other, less useful (in the K8s context) code. At the&nbsp;CoreOS booth I learned that rkt is right now not yet a drop-in replacement for Docker, but may well be soon - work is being done, and quickly. <!--more--> I tried to get into the [Deep Dive](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/cloudnativecon-and-kubecon-europe/program/schedule) track, but that was close to impossible - A03 was permanently overcrowded and people that managed to get a seat then did the sensible thing and camped out. Talks have been recorded and so I will have a look at [Kubernetes Scheduling](https://cloudnativeeu2017.sched.com/event/9Tc8/kubernetes-scheduling-features-or-how-can-i-make-the-system-do-what-i-want-i-marek-grabowski-wojciech-tyczynski-google?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no), [The Open Service Broker API](https://cloudnativeeu2017.sched.com/event/9TcX/the-open-service-broker-api-and-the-kubernetes-service-catalog-b-paul-morie-red-hat-chip-childers-cloud-foundry-foundation?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) and [Autoscaling](https://cloudnativeeu2017.sched.com/event/9Tcr/autoscaling-in-kubernetes-i-marcin-wielgus-google?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) later. I also managed to get a private demo of [Vault Integation](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/vault-controller) with Kubernetes by [Kelsey Hightower](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/cloudnativecon-and-kubecon-europe/program/schedule) himself, at the Google booth (and yes, that was the one time his demo failed, Hassan! He was quite annoyed, but they changed the API underneath him). The README.pm workflow looks quite convoluted, but is designed to integrate Vault without changing the Kubernetes core and without pre-trusting anything. With these preconditions and going through each of the steps on by one, the flow can be explained and each step is required. The rest of the conference&nbsp;I spent in private meetings, and in the hallway track, which was also quite productive. Kubernetes is exciting, because it's a project that is mainly driven by users needs, and because it is opinionated: It tries to solve a class of problems its users have, and it does not try to be each and everything to everyone. Vanilla Kubernetes from GitHub can be built quite easily, and is actually useful without additional, proprietary components. This Kubecon was very energetic, but it could also observed that now the vendors are rushing in. It is my hope that the CNCF regulates this, and prevents the project from becoming vendor driven or losing focus, degenerating into a sales tool and branding&nbsp;program.</p>
