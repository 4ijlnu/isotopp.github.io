<p>[caption id="attachment\_1232" align="alignleft" width="195"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cover-195x300.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B06XKSMZDP) [How to kill a city](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B06XKSMZDP)[/caption] Peter Moskowitz has written a book on "Gentrification, Inequality, and the Fight for the Neighborhood", titled "How to Kill a City". It's available on [Kindle](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B06XKSMZDP)&nbsp;for some 11 Euro. There is a matching article in The Atlantic, [The Steady Destruction of America's Cities](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/03/gentrification-moskowitz/519057/). Based on observations in Detroit, San Francisco, New York and Post-Katrina New Orleans, he tries to explain the process of Gentrification and distinguish it from urban renewal or other forms of change that are frequent in cities.</p>
<p>> While urban renewal, the suburbanization of cities, and other forms of capital creation are relatively easy to spot (a highway built through a neighborhood is a relatively obvious event), gentrification is more discreet, dispersed, and hands-off,‚Äù he writes. Moskowitz adds to the growing canon aimed at understanding and explaining the process of gentrification, and he not so subtly suggests that while gentrification &nbsp;naturally brings some improvements to a city,including more people and money, it also frequently kills some cultural traditions and diversity, the precise characteristics that make cities so dynamic and desirable in the first place.</p>
