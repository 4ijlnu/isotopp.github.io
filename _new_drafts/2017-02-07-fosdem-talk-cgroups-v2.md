<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cgroups-v2.png)](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/cgroupv2/)[The talk](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/cgroupv2/)<!--more--> The cgroups-v2 API is incompatible with cgroups-v1. This is a good thing, because the initial use cases for cgroups have not been fleshed out properly, and the API is kind of overly complicated from the POV of the consumers. v2 is being built with use cases and experience in mind, and is much easier to use. Control groups allow Linux users to limit the kind and amount of resources being used, which is employed by systemd, container drivers and many other things.</p>
