<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/watchman-283x300.png)](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) Today I was looking for a way to subscribe to file changes in a directory in MacOS, in order to trigger automatically running commands whenever files change. Turns out Homebrew has "fswatch", which tells you when things change, but little else. Turns out Homebrew has "watchman", which does all this, and on multiple trees, finds changes across restarts and automatically manages a set of commands for different file endings. Also turns out that I know the author. Thanks, Wez!</p>
