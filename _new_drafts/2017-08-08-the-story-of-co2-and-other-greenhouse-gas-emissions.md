We also learn about CO2 produced vs. CO2 in the atmosphere, which is a delayed system. The second part then deals with CO2 and industrialisation: Emission vs. Properity, vs. Growth, and also with CO2 from trade and transport, and from meat production. As always with Our World in Data, the article concludes with Definitions, Methods and pointers to raw data sources.</p>
