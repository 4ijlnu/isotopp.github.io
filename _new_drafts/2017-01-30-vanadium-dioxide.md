<p>A strange material: [Vanadium Dioxide](http://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-have-found-a-metal-that-conducts-electricity-but-not-heat). At certain temperatures it transports electricity, but not heat. That's unexpected, because of the [Widemann-Franz law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiedemann%E2%80%93Franz_law), which says that the two should be related. Another weird - [but not new property](https://phys.org/news/2013-11-vanadium-dioxide-smart-glass-block.html) of the material:&nbsp;transparent to around 30 degrees Celsius, but then reflects infrared while remaining transparent to visible light.</p>
