<p>Originating in London is the concept of the [Tweed Run](http://www.tweedrun.com/). It's a bunch of fucking hipsters, riding outdated bikes in impractical clothing through gentrified neighborhoods flashing their privilege. Or in their [own words](http://www.tweedrun.com/etiquette/):</p>
<p>> The term "overdressed" does not exist in our vocabulary. Tweed suits, plus fours, bowties, and jaunty flat caps are all encouraged. […] Dust off your vintage velocipede for the ride; prizes awarded for Best Vintage Bicycle. […] Of course dining al fresco is an art all of its own, and we encourage you to pack a beautiful picnic basket for our Picnic Break.</p>
<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/london-tweed-run-239x300.jpg)](http://www.tweedrun.com/) A similar thing happens in the Netherlands under the label "[Tweed Ride](http://www.tweedride.nl/)". They are an inclusive folk, addressing both Nederlands and English speaking people. Their next event is coming [Sunday, May 28th, in Breda](http://www.tweedride.nl/deelnemen).</p>
