(yes really)« [whitequark:](https://twitter.com/whitequark/status/886932390224048128) »oh my god did they put the DDR EEPROM on the same SMBus as IME and integrated Ethernet« but [Graham Sutherland:](https://twitter.com/gsuberland/status/886933115645702144) »I've looked at about 100 laptop schematics now and only found one which does it. There are probably more but it's still not bad going.« so while everything is indeed in fire, apparently it's only smouldering.</p>
