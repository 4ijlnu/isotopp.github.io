TL;DR: Everybody in traffic is breaking the law, but for different reasons. <!--more-->[The JTLU paper finds](https://jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/view/871):</p>
<p>> When including driving and pedestrian scenario responses—such as how often respondents drive over the speed limit or jaywalk— **100% of our sample population admitted to some form of law-breaking in the transportation system** (i.e., everybody is technically a criminal). When disaggregating by mode, 95.87% of bicyclists, 97.90% of pedestrians, and nearly all drivers (99.97%) selected responses that would be considered illegal. The rationale for why these road users were breaking the law, however, differed by mode. Drivers and pedestrians that break the rules of the road tended to do so to save time (77% and 85% of drivers and pedestrians, respectively). However, bicyclists report disregarding the rules of road for other reasons. The most prevalent response as to why bicyclists break the rules was “personal safety” with more than 71% of respondents citing that as a reason. Saving energy came in second for bicyclists (56%) followed by saving time (50%). Increasing one’s visibility was the fourth most cited response (47%) for bicyclists breaking the law. While the overwhelming majority of bicyclists break the rules, the open response answers suggest that most do so in situations where little harm would come to themselves or others and are often motivated by concerns for their own safety because they feel like an afterthought in a car-dominated transportation system.</p>
<p> That ties in nicely with the findings in&nbsp;[We learned a few things about Cycle Path design in the last 25 years](http://blog.koehntopp.info/index.php/1064-we-learned-a-few-things-about-cycle-path-design-in-the-last-25-years/)&nbsp;elsewhere in this blog.</p>
