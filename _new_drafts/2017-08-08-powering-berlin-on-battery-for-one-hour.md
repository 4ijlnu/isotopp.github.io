<p>> The planned project, which Oldenburg-based EWE Gasspeicher is billing as the worldâ€™s largest battery, will involve filling two salt caverns, each of around 100,000 cubic meters in volume, with brine to create a redox flow battery that has capacity of up to 120 megawatts and 700 megawatt-hours.</p>
