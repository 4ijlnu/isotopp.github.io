<p>An [article at I am Expat](http://www.iamexpat.nl/read-and-discuss/lifestyle/news/amsterdam-shops-to-open-24-hours-during-trial) points at an experiment with deregulated opening hourse in Amsterdam. Already, [Shops in the Netherlands can opt to be open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_hours#Netherlands) between 6am and 10pm. With the experiment, shops in some areas in Amsterdam will be allowed to be open around the clock. The experiment is to be monitored, and the results will be used to decide a more general rule.</p>
