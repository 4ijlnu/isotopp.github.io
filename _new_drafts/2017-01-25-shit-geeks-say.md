<p>So the [Geeks at Datacenter Dynamics](http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/content-tracks/design-build/stockholm-data-parks-welcomes-data-center-developers/97699.article) quote this geek:</p>
<p>> “With a market of more than 80 million people within a roundtrip delay of 30 milliseconds, covering all major cities of Northern Europe, the Baltic states and western Russia, Stockholm is an ideal location for cloud players and other major data center actors,” …</p>
<p> So how many million people are within 30ms of you? :-) [![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/19917_Stocholm-1-1024x320.jpg)](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/19917_Stocholm-1.jpg) In other news, the more countries go renewable, the less they are charging for power (they may be charging for infrastructure, though). For data centers in Norway and Sweden, it appears that we are below 4 Cent/kWh now. Oh, and can we please use the exhaust heat from your computers to heat our capital, please?</p>
