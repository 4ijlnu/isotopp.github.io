<p>And while we are at it, [here is](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/10/rio-olympic-venues-already-falling-into-a-state-of-disrepair) what the olympic village, the stadiums and the rest of the Rio Olympics look like today. **EDIT:** Someone pointed me at [this article and podcast](https://theringer.com/the-olympics-cant-exist-in-this-world-7c8e089747bd#.p08rijo1q).</p>
<p>> In 2013, all four regions associated with a Munich bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics voted against it; six months later, almost 70 percent of voters in Krakow voted against a bid for the same event; the Swiss canton of Graub√ºnden voted down a 2022 bid in 2013 and two weeks ago voted even more vigorously against a 2026 bid; Hamburg narrowly voted down a bid for the 2024 Olympics in 2015; after Boston was awarded the opportunity to bid for the 2024 games by the USOC, residents of the city and state were so vehemently against the bid that the planned referendum never happened. Vienna has already very strongly voted against the possibility of hosting the 2028 games.</p>
