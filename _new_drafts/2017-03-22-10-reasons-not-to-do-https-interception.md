<p>Marnix Dekker has [an article on HTTPS interception](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/9-reasons-intercept-https-marnix-dekker) as it is being done in some workplaces. He lists:</p>
<p>- Are you serious? We worked so hard to make the web more secure and you are fucking it up.<br />
- HSTS, you are breaking it.<br />
- Blinds the browser and the user, because you re-encrypt with wildcard certs.<br />
- Disrupts personal use.<br />
- Breaks pinning and CT.<br />
- Breaks with consumerization.<br />
- Disrupts BYOD.<br />
- Discourages good user practices.<br />
- Limited benefits.<br />
- and finally: Hard shell, soft inside is not going to work.<br />
