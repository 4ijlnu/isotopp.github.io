<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-02-at-22.52.26-300x276.png)](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-02-at-22.52.26.png)This blog accepts comments without any authentication or account: You can simply enter any name and email address and write stuff. Spam is filtered out via Akismet, and the Email is mostly used for Pre-Approval of comments. Some people [in a discussion on Google plus](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+jwildeboer/posts/aPgTcmPZiiK) have been asking for social login buttons using OAuth2 based authentication instead, because they cannot be bothered to enter an Email address (Seems to be mostly a problem on mobile).<!--more--> So I have installed the OneAll social authentication plugin. It's use is optional, you can still use the old method to comment. If you are using OneAll and a social network to save yourself entering an Email address, you do leave a data trace on the social network you are using to OAuth2 against, and at the OneAll servers. The image above shows a bit of the analytics they generate from that. If you are using traditional commenting, this does not happen. OAuth2 is really not designed to minimise data&nbsp;footprints.</p>
