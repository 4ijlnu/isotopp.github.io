<p>So Microsoft just blogged [this](https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/07/05/transform-your-organization-with-microsoft-workplace-analytics/):</p>
<p>> Transform your organization with Microsoft Workplace Analytics Workplace Analytics taps into Office 365 email and calendar metadata, including to/from data, subject lines and timestamps, to shine a light on how the organization collaborates and spends time. It turns this digital exhaust—the data that comes naturally from our everyday work—into a set of behavioral metrics that can be used to understand what’s going on in an organization.</p>
<p><!--more-->Meanwhile, at work, people are discussing documents like "the human era @work" ([PDF](http://uli.org/wp-content/uploads/ULI-Documents/The-Human-Era-at-Work.pdf)) and are posting images like the following into the discussion: [![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/office-169x300.jpg)](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/office.jpg) In a way, Microsoft never ceases to amaze me in how out-of-touch they are with the current. It started with The Internet, continued with The Cloud, and now extends even into The Workplace. In any meaningful, modern workplace the data collected by Office is indeed digital exhaust and relying in any way on these numbers will produce an extremely skewed and wrong image of what is going on in the company.</p>
