<p>Cycling outside of the Netherlands isâ€¦ sometimes complicated. [@Polizeibeobachter](https://twitter.com/Poliauwei) is showing a case from Berlin. [![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/saatwinkler-damm.jpg)](https://twitter.com/Poliauwei/status/861361175988252673) This is a DriveNow parked completely blocking a cyclepath at Saatwinkler Damm, Berlin. Police have been called, but cop on the ground refused to have the car towed ("I see no reason to have this towed"). It took two hours to get the police district supervisor to come out, check this out - and have it towed.</p>
