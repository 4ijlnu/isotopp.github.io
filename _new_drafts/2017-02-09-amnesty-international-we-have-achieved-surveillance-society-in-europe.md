<p>The Amnesty Report "[Dangerously Disproportionate: The Ever-Expanding National Security State in Europe](https://www.amnesty.de/files/Amnesty-Bericht-EU-Antiterrorgesetze-Januar2017.pdf)" (PDF) goes through the states of Europes and their respective implementation of the surveillance state - emergency laws, principle of legality, privacy, freedom of expression, liberty, freedom of movement, and other categories are being investigated. The summary states:</p>
<p>> [B]y proposing, adopting and implementing wave after wave of counter-terrorism measures that have eroded the rule of law, enhanced executive powers, peeled away judicial controls, restricted freedom of expression and exposed everyone to government surveillance. Brick by brick, the edifice of rights protection that was so carefully constructed after the Second World War, is being dismantled. This report aims to give a bird’s eye view of the national security landscape in Europe. It shows just how widespread and deep the “securitization” of Europe has become since 2014. The report reflects a world in which fear, alienation and prejudice are steadily chipping away at the cornerstones of the EU: fairness, equality and non-discrimination.</p>
