<p>In case you are frustrated by the current state of things in Mac land, and were considering trying out the all new and reformed Microsoft, which now supposedly does not suck any more: [cnet provides you with a rather long article](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-windows-10-forced-updates-auto-restarts-are-the-worst/) about stories of Windows 10 updating when asked not to, and at&nbsp;the most inconvenient times. The article is full of stories of Windows force rebooting into an hour long upgrade while taking notes at a keynote event, while 3D printing a multi-hour job, or during a Skype hiring interview. Microsoft basically thinks their updates are more important than your work.</p>
