<p>Looking at Berlin in the 70ies, you can also see how much cities change with more cars - the images here look unreal to anyone&nbsp;used to todays cities. [caption id="attachment\_1532" align="aligncenter" width="300"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kreuzberg-70ies-300x201.png)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/131765467@N06/albums/72157663143401420/with/24102264579/) [Kreuzberg in the 70ies](https://www.flickr.com/photos/131765467@N06/albums/72157663143401420/with/24102264579/) on Flickr[/caption] There is an older article in [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21720269-dont-let-people-park-free-how-not-create-traffic-jams-pollution-and-urban-sprawl) about Parking in Cities, and Zoning rules that require building parking spaces when building new housing. <!--more--> The impact that parking, unused cars, have on the design of public space is quite astonishing. The article illustrates that using the new Apple HQ in Cupertino as an example - a building with 318k sqm of office and 325k sqm of parking space, as required by local zoning rules. The situation is complicated, even in cities such as Amsterdam, which do have functioning public transport and are attractive to Biking - people still own cars, and want to park them where they live. Permits are still too cheaply priced, for political reasons, and that is changing only slowly (check out neighboring Haarlem for a slightly more aggressive approach to keep cars out of the historic centre). But things are slowly improving, closes the article. More and more cities are realising what they are doing to their urban environment by keeping cars inside, and are modifying regulations.</p>
