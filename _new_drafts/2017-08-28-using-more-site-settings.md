<p>[caption id="attachment\_2503" align="aligncenter" width="391"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/site-settings-391x640.jpg)](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/site-settings.jpg) Site-Settings can be useful to simplify the web.[/caption] Site-Settings in Chrome can be accessed by pressing the Info-Circle next to the Sitename above a web page. A dropdown shows the rules for the site, usually "Ask (default)". Sites with annoying Ad-Tech that sneaks around the Adblocker can often be silenced by disabling Javascript and Flash completely. It is not necessary to disable other settings, especially if the default is "Ask" - a requester will pop up before a feature such as e.g. Location is being used.</p>
