<p>The final part of the Van Helsing's Diaries by Peter Cawdron titled [Nosferatu](https://www.amazon.de/Nosferatu-van-Helsings-Diaries-English-ebook/dp/B071P8FX22) is out, and the entire series is available in one single Omnibus Edition. Similarly, [Maelstrom](https://www.amazon.de/Maelstrom-Colliding-Worlds-English-Cawdron-ebook/dp/B072PPFCSL), the final part of Colliding Worlds, is out, and in an Omnibus, too. Maelstrom is also on kindle unlimited. Judging by [past](http://blog.koehntopp.info/index.php/898-fertig-gelesen-explorations-first-contact/) [writing](http://blog.koehntopp.info/index.php/895-fertig-gelesen-galactic-exploration/) of Cawdron, you can't go wrong with buying it and 0.99 EUR each is an acceptable financial risk. :-) &nbsp;</p>
