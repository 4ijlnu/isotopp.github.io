<p>Short link to [NBC Miami](http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/South-Miami-Set-to-Become-First-City-in-Florida-to-Require-Solar-Panels-on-New-Homes-434557443.html):</p>
<p>> South Miami Set to Become First City in Florida to Require Solar Panels on New Homes The new law would require owners of new homes -- including single-family homes, townhouses and multi-story residential buildings -- to install solar panels. It also applies to owners who expand their homes by 75% or greater. Once the measure is passed, South Miami would become the fourth U.S. city that requires new homes to be installed with solar panels. San Francisco and two small cities in California have similar renewable energy building laws.</p>
