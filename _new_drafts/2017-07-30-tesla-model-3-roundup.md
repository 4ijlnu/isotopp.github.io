<p>[caption id="attachment\_2303" align="aligncenter" width="640"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/model-3-interior-glass-roof-blue-sky-640x515.png)](http://www.businessinsider.de/tesla-model-3-first-drive-2017-7?r=US&IR=T) [Business Insider drove a Model 3](http://www.businessinsider.de/tesla-model-3-first-drive-2017-7) and it was good.[/caption] The large version has a range of 500km, does 0-100 in 5.1s (faster than any non-RS Audis) and top speed is 210 km/h. Preorders have surpassed 500k. [Another review](http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-3/2018/exclusive-tesla-model-3-first-drive-review/) from Motor Trend is also enthusiastic. Meanwhile, many newspapers are asking the obvious question:<!--more--></p>
<p>- "[If legacy automakers can beat Tesla, why can't they comply with China's EV mandate?](http://insideevs.com/legacy-automakers-must-comply-china-beat-tesla/)" That's harsh: Legacy Automakers. </p>
<p>> In addition to delaying the mandate, the automakers want to weaken the penalty system for companies that don’t meet the quotas […] Meanwhile, some of these same companies, and their apologists in the media, insist that, once they finally decide to commit to electrification, they’re going to easily beat Tesla at its own game. “Anything Tesla can do, we can surpass,” boasted Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess in May.</p>
<p>- "[As Tesla Model 3 hits the streets, where are the other electric vehicles?](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-28/why-electric-vehicles-are-coming-but-not-yet-here-quicktake-q-a)" as ask Bloomberg.<br />
- Meanwhile, German car makers and politicians are still in mourning (or is it moroning?) over the Diesel. Jörg Hoffman (IG Metall, Trade Union) is against Diesel bans (the subject is no longer up for vote, the bans are a legal requirement).He's worried about the loss of resale value in Diesel cars: "[Hundertausende Menschen werden kalt enteignet](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/diesel-affaere/f-a-s-exklusiv-hunderttausende-menschen-werden-kalt-enteignet-15127971.html)." (Article in German) ("Hundreds of thousands of people are being silently disowned").<br />
- Swiss newspaper [Der Bund has some background](http://www.derbund.ch/wirtschaft/unternehmen-und-konjunktur/wie-audi-in-die-katastrophe-trieb/story/29963833)&nbsp;(Article in German) on Audi and how it came to Dieselgate.<br />
- German Minister of Economy [Zypries is against a fixed exit date for cars with combustion engines](http://www.n-tv.de/wirtschaft/Zypries-ist-gegen-generelles-Verbot-article19960172.html)&nbsp;(Article in German). And she want it to be uniform across the European Union.<br />
- [Volkswagen needs to source EV motors](http://insideevs.com/volkswagen-turns-chinese-factory-production-120000-ev-motors-annually/), though. In China. Yup. Also, 120.000 - while Tesla has half a million preorders.<br />
 Also, NOx Whataboutism. "What about Trucks? And Buses?" [caption id="attachment\_2305" align="aligncenter" width="214"] ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nox-sources-214x300.jpg) Yes, what about them Trucks?[/caption]</p>
