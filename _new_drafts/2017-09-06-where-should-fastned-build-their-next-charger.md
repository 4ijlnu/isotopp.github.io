We are looking for easy to reach places that are reachable around the lock. To build, we need 400m^2 along an Autobahn or Bundesstra√üe, or 150m^2 in cities. Find more information about FastNeds placement critieria in our presentation. If you are an owner or think you can otherwise helpful in location selection, please contact us via standorte@fastned.de.</p>
