<p>Linus Ã…kesson has been creating a [C64 based demo that fits into 256 bytes](http://www.linusakesson.net/scene/a-mind-is-born/index.php). Since there is no 256 byte demo compo competition, he submitted it as a 4K entry - and won. The article shows the 256 bytes hexdump of the demo, and discusses structure and code. A video of the executioni is being provided, too. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWblpsLZ-O8</p>
