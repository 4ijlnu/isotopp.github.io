<p>[Ramez Naam](https://www.amazon.com/Ramez-Naam/e/B001IOH84S)&nbsp;is an Ex-Microsoft employee who is now an Angel Investor and [science fiction writer](https://www.amazon.com/Ramez-Naam/e/B001IOH84S). Here he speaks about the financial dynamics of solar and wind power. [caption id="attachment\_2226" align="aligncenter" width="1024"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/solar-1024x452.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCeC4a_p1-Y) [Energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCeC4a_p1-Y)[/caption] He has examples of solar not only bankrupting very large and profitable coal companies, but some solar projects are being disrupted by falling prices of solar energy. That is, the build time for some projects have been so long that by the time they would have been built prices would have been falling so much that they would not have been profitable.</p>
