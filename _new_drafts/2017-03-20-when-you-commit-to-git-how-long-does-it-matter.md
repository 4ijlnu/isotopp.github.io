He was trying to find out what the half-life of code is. That is, when you commit to a repository, your code becomes part of a project, but eventually other code will replace it and it will no longer be part of the current version. How stable is the codebase, what is the half-life of code? And why is it different in different projects?</p>
<p>> As a project evolves, does the new code just add on top of the old code? Or does it replace the old code slowly over time? In order to understand this, I built a little thing to analyze Git projects, with help from the formidable GitPython project. The idea is to go back in history historical and run a git blame [â€¦]</p>
