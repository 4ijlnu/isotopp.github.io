<p>[The Telegraph had a article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/03/revealed-self-styled-grammar-vigilante-corrects-badly-punctuated/?WT.mc_id=tmg_share_tw) on a self-styled 'grammar vigilante', who corrects badly punctuated shop signs in the dead of the night, and the article has not been dated April, 1st. </p>
<p>> […] the man has corrected tens of missing and misplaced apostrophes on shop banners across Bristol over the past 13 years. The pedant, who is yet to reveal his identity, claims his efforts are needed to bring an end to the improper use of English.</p>
<p> Meanwhile, innocent bystanders complain about the title 'grammar vigilante', because: </p>
<p>> Melania Branton, a poet from North Somerset, said that whoever the ‘grammar vigilante’ turns out to be “must be wincing at the misnomer, as punctuation isn’t grammar”.</p>
<p> Right.</p>
