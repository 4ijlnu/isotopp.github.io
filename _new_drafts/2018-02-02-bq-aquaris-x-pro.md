<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bq_aquaris_x_pro-150x150.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B06XWYX439) Last weekend my Nexus 5X did the Boot Loop Thing ([Article](https://www.computerbase.de/2018-02/lg-bootschleife-smartphone-g4-g5-nexus-5x/) in German, refund only for US customers). So I needed a new device, quickly. I am certainly not spending 1K Euro on hardware, so I was looking for a Nexus 5X priced device that does not suck. Harald recommended I am looking at [bq.com](https://www.bq.com/en/), a spanish company that makes 3D printers, and smartphones, and indeed the [X pro](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B06XWYX439) delivers. 5X sized, the device can do dual-SIM or SIM+SD, has up to 128 GB memory (I got the 64 GB model), a decent camera and a close to stock Android with a bi-monthly update cycle. Android 7.1.1 with a late 2017 patchlevel in my code. Less than 300 EUR, performs as advertised. Oh, and the selfie frontside flash is Men-in-Black level weird. <!--more--> [caption id="attachment\_2981" align="aligncenter" width="640"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/aquaris-x-pro-memory-640x434.png)](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/aquaris-x-pro-memory.png) This is my full Kindle Library, a lot of downloaded music and a dozen pre-downloaded Netflix videos, and I am still about 50% memory available.<br />
There is a 128 GB video, but in order to justify this, I would probably have to become an Instagram Girl.[/caption]</p>
