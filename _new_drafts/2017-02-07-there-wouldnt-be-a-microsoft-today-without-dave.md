Cutler not only has been one of the architects of the VAX and their VMS operating system, but also in the designs of the DEC Alpha CPU and its predecessors. Later at Microsoft, he has been working on the DEC Alpha port of Windows NT, been instrumental in the development of the Windows Server operating system, and been a lead developer in Microsoft's cloud system, Azure. He's also been involved in porting the Hyper-V Hypervisor to the XBox. It is really rare to find people who have been working in IT for so long, who have been involved in so many aspects - from hardware and chip design through operating system design to platform architecture and virtualisation, and even more so, who have been doing this in an ecosystem that is independent and outside of the Unix/Linux universe.</p>
