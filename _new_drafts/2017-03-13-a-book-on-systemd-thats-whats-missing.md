<p> ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pid-eins.png) Two years ago, I [ranted on Google plus](https://plus.google.com/+KristianK%C3%B6hntopp/posts/d8QK4wp9hpB) that there still is no book on systemd (actually, on systemd + journald + cgroups/namespaces and the assorted things that come with it if you are doing it right). There are writeups such as various [Getting Started](https://www.certdepot.net/rhel7-get-started-systemd/) articles, and there is collections to the writeups on [PID Eins](http://www.databook.bz/?page_id=2578), but there is no book. A book would be good, though, because it should contain [stuff like this](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/334471/how-do-i-reload-a-group-of-systemd-services).</p>
