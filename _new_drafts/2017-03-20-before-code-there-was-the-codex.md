<p>Nautilus has an [article by Philip Auerswald](http://nautil.us/blog/civilization-is-built-on-code), Author of The Code Economy: A Forty-Thousand-Year History. Auerswald tries to tie our current practice of crystallising rules in Code back to the Codexes and&nbsp;Recipes of older times, and sees our civilisation as a system of dealing with complexity by packaging and encapsulating it. According to Auerswald, running Code on machines is new, previously we have been running it on humans:</p>
<p>> “Code” as I intend it incorporates elements of computer code, genetic code, cryptologic code, and other forms as well. But, as I describe in my book The Code Economy: A Forty-Thousand Year History, published this year, it also stands as its own concept—the algorithms that guide production in the economy—for which no adequate word yet exists. Code can include instructions we follow consciously and purposively, and those we follow unconsciously and intuitively.</p>
