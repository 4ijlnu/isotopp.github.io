<p>Here is a [user story](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories)&nbsp;for implementors of security systems and platform hardening initiatives:</p>
<p>> As **any user** , I never want to get a "denied" message, but a " **in order to do what you want you are missing the&nbsp;_X_ permission**" message in order to be able to track down the root cause and request the appropriate permissions more easily.</p>
<p> It's not that hard, really. </p>
<p>> GitLab: You are not allowed to push code to this project.</p>
<p> Well, it's harder for some, apparently. That's one hour of my life I am not getting back.</p>
