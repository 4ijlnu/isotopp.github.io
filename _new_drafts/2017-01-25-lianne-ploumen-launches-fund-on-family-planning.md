"Banning abortion does not lead to fewer abortions. It leads to more irresponsible practices in back rooms and to more mothers dying." She's&nbsp;launching an international fund to make up for the about $600 million gap created by Trump's decision to scrap funding to organizations that help with family planning and offer safe abortions in developing countries (Nope, that's not the USA. Yet.) &nbsp;</p>
