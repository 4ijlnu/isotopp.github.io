<p>[Trustico](https://trustico.eu) is an SSL reseller, which [just compromised](https://twitter.com/geofft/status/968937746214596610) 23.000 certificates they sold. TL;DR: Forget your EV or other certs. Just run "Let's Encrypt". It gets you a cert, it's fresh, and it does not make any difference whatsoever. At least not any you or anyone else can check for, or cares for. [caption id="attachment\_3080" align="aligncenter" width="300"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/trustico-ad-300x151.png)](https://web.archive.org/web/20180301013921/https://www.trustico.com/news/2018/symantec-revocation/certificate-replacement.php) Actual Trustico ad from their website (Screenshot 01-Mar-2018)[/caption] Here is how:<!--more--> Chrome is going to distrust the Symantec root certificate soon, because they failed at running a Certificate Authority properly, repeatedly. Certificates by a reseller that are being rooted at Symantec will become invalid, no matter what their runtime in the Cert is. Trustico wanted to move their customers from Symantec to Comodo, another company that failed at running a Certificate Authority properly, repeatedly, but which is not distrusted by Chrome, yet. They asked Digicert, who bought the business of Symantec, to revoke ("cancel") the certs they sold to their customers, just because they say so. That, said Digicert, is not possible, because the conditions for revoking a certificate have not been met, and if you are trying to revoke a certificate just because someone said so you are not running a Certificate Authority properly and they would like stopping to do that. Apparently Digicert also gave examples of proper causes for certificate revokation, and the one prime cause for revoking a cert is when the private key for a cert (which is supposed to be a secret only known to the proper owner of a cert, which is neither Digicert nor Trustico) being made known to people who have no business knowing it. So the CEO of Trustico, [Zane Lucas](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/zanelucas), mailed the private keys of 23000 Trustico customers to Digicert, effectively invalidating them and at the same time proving that Trustico has knowledge of all their customers private keys, keeping copies of them, which proves that they never knew how to run a Certficate Authority business in the first place, and compromising all their 23000 customers security retroactively, and also ending their own presence in the security space forever. So Digicert needed help to do a mass cert revocation, and also informed the customers of Trustico of the situation, directly. Which angered the CEO of Trustico, because it made their absolute and limitless incompetence public.
