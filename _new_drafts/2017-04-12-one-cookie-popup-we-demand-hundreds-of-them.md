<p>You can't read any website anywhere in Europe without getting a completely useless "We too are using Cookies" overlay. This has been such a unmitigated success that there exists a separate "Kill all Cookie banners" category in every Adblocker available. But, says the Article 29 group of European Privacy Commissioners, is by far not annoying enough, we can do worse. Consent cannot be given in general, you need to make this more specific. That is, they demand hundreds of these overlays on each site ([PDF](http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44103)). Page 17 of that PDF:</p>
<p>> The end-user must be able to give separate consent per &nbsp;website or app for tracking for different purposes (such as social media sharing or advertising). [â€¦] For both browsers and data controllers this means it would be invalid if they would only offer an option 'to accept all cookies', since this would not enable users to provide the required granular consent.</p>
<p> Right. How is this even practical.</p>
