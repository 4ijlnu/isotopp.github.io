It has a range of about 100 miles, and costs $5000. It won't be sold outside of China. The GM Press Release is [here](http://media.gm.com/media/cn/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/cn/en/2017/July/0721_SAIC-GM-Wuling-Launches-Baojun-E100.html). <!--more--> Martin Seeger writes:</p>
<p>> Concerning the car industry, this is a weapon of mass destruction.... For combustion cars, the range is no cost driver. For electric car it is. But there is a reverse implication in that. Once electric cars reach the cost level of normal cars for the long range, they will be much cheaper than combustion cars on the short range. 100 miles per charge is more than enough for the average user. One thing I love about electric cars: there is a huge incentive to save weight and size. I abhor the tank sized SUVs that infest our streets. Perhaps such developments will curb them...</p>
