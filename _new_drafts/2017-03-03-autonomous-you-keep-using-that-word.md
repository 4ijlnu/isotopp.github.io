<p>> Thanks for the pointer. Cars need 5G [networking] because of latency. Short reaction time for braking.</p>
<p> [caption id="attachment\_960" align="aligncenter" width="592"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-03-at-14.45.37.png)](https://twitter.com/ARDreporter/status/836875962318995457) [Autonomous](https://twitter.com/ARDreporter/status/836875962318995457)[/caption] Nope. That's not how it works. (Twitter thread starts at [https://twitter.com/ARDreporter/status/836838622716395520](https://twitter.com/ARDreporter/status/836838622716395520)) Generally: Cars cannot trust externally supplied data ("cloud data") for critical&nbsp;driving safety things. The cloud may be unavailable, the link into the cloud may be unavailable or the information fed into the cloud may be wrong, maliciously wrong or outdated. So all that external environment information is as trustworthy as the spoken traffic report after the radio news, it's a machine readable, more detailed version of exactly that. Ground truth&nbsp;from the sensors always has to be able to supercede that, and the car must always be able to drive safely with ground truth from sensors alone.</p>
