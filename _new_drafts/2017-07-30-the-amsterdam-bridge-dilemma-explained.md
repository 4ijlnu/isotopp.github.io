<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bridge-vs-tall-ships-640x426.jpg)](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/07/netherlands-bridge-tunnel-debate/535074/) An article in Citylab explains [The Amsterdam Bridge Dilemma](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/07/netherlands-bridge-tunnel-debate/535074/). Bascially, Amsterdam needs the area north of the IJ to grow, but for that to be attractive, it needs to be reachable by bike. So a tunnel is not going to cut it, a bridge is necessary. But tall ships are crossing all interesting locations right now, so either the bridge has to be very high - not attractive to bikers or it has to open, in which case it will be open 50% of the time in high season. Solutions are possible, but they will restructure the city and tourism in the city. In itself also not a bad thing, but complicated.</p>
