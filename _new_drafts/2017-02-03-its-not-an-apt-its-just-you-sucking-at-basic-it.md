And Levy goes:</p>
<p>> “If you call it an advanced persistent threat, you end up with a narrative that basically says ‘you lot are too stupid to understand this and only I can possibly help you – buy my magic amulet and you’ll be fine.’ It’s medieval witchcraft, it’s genuinely medieval witchcraft.”</p>
<p> and continues </p>
<p>> He pointed out that a UK telco had recently been taken offline using a SQL injection flaw that was older than the hacker alleged to have used it. That’s not advanced by any stretch of the imagination, he said.</p>
<p> So there you have it. It's not an APT. It's you sucking at running an IT organisation.</p>
