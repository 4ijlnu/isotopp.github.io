<p>Neulandrebellen with [Frauke voll der Gnade](http://www.neulandrebellen.de/2017/02/frauke-voll-der-gnade/) (german language article) explains the difference between the subject (of the crown) and a citzen: Where the subject has to plead for mercy by throwing themselves at the feet of their ruler, the citzen has rights, and the law, speaking to the state as an equal. The article then goes on to show how an important part of the neoliberal agenda in "pushing back the state" is also pushing back human rights, reducing having them to an act of mercy. Starting point for the line of reasing&nbsp;was AfD's Frauke Petry, who was trying to re-frame the german constitutionally grounded _right_ for Asylum (and because it's a right you can sue for it) into an act of mercy. But while this is a starting point, the article goes on to paint this as part of a larger picture, and a systematic agenta. "Less state" also - and always - means less rights, and hence more dependency on Mercy. For everybody, not just refugees.</p>
