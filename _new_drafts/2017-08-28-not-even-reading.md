<p>Why do companies think about Chatbots and other abominations for customer support? Because already their Fleshbots are not even reading what the customer writes. Here for example is my password strength for the KLM website: ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-28-at-09.28.47.png) »But Kris, that's terrible. Why don't you set a proper password?« <!--more-->Well, there is this: ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-28-at-09.32.56.png) »Seriously, 4 numeric characters only?« Well, no, they even suck at sucking, it's actually taking up to 6 numeric characters. But seriously, KLM? This is how it is done: ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-28-at-09.34.42.png) Would you please kindly unfuck your password management? Well, let's ask: ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-28-at-09.35.44.png) That looks like a phishing attempt to me, but that's the actual KLM account, so let's try it: ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-28-at-09.36.17.png) Aaand: ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-28-at-09.38.10.png) Nope, you did not even read what I wrote. ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-28-at-09.39.51.png) Monday morning soundtrack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9-r8NZmbFE</p>
