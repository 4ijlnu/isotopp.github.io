<p>[The Register reports](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/16/microsoft_stockpiling_flaws_too/): </p>
<p>> [O]ur analysis of the metadata within these patches shows these files were built and digitally signed by Microsoft on February 11, 13 and 17, the same week it had prepared updates for its supported versions of Windows. In other words, Microsoft had fixes ready to go for its legacy systems in mid-February but only released them to the public last Friday after the world was engulfed in WannaCrypt. Here's the dates in the patches:<br />
> - Windows 8 RT (64-bit x86): Feb 13, 2017<br />
> - Windows 8 RT (32-bit x86): Feb 13, 2017<br />
> - Windows Server 2003 (64-bit x86): Feb 11, 2017<br />
> - Windows Server 2003 (32-bit x86): Feb 11, 2017<br />
> - Windows XP: Feb 11, 2017<br />
> - Windows XP Embedded: Feb 17, 2017</p>
<p> This is bad.</p>
