<p>So, Wikileaks has been publishing a bunch of documents from the CIA, regarding hacking tools and working with tech and crypto under the headline of [Vault 7](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/). In their words,</p>
<p>> Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named "Vault 7" by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency. The first full part of the series, "Year Zero", comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina.</p>
<p> Much has been made about the timing of this release, with regards to Trump's Russian connection or other political context. That may or may not be true, but it's actually relatively unimportant. <!--more--> What we learn here is something more: The CIA (and probaby the other 16 US secret services) have been hoarding zero day exploits, just like the russian, chinese or other secret services in the world. They have been developing technology to turn everyday household appliances into listening devices, to sabotage critical infrastructure (instead of helping to secure it), and they have been financing the development of software making systems insecure in the private economy - which then finds its way one way or the other into the world. In more than one way that puts&nbsp;the CIA&nbsp;closer to their russian, chinese or whatever other nations secret service than to their people. Continuing their spying operations, keeping systems insecure, is more important to them than to securing their own peoples infrastructure, keeping their own people safe or providing actual security. If you are building IT systems, "Us vs. Them" means "Us" being you and your people, and "Them" all of the worlds secret services (and organized crime, the difference is most likely smaller than anybody thinks, especially when it comes to methods employed), including and especially the ones of your own country. via&nbsp;[a G+ post by Torsten Kleinz (german language)](https://plus.google.com/107223467325602754395/posts/6z41bZsNErq)</p>
