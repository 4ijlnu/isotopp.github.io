<p> ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/C4Im-HoWYAAbmiS-300x208.png)[Dan Luu has been benchmarking the web](https://danluu.com/web-bloat/), using [Webpagetest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) and other means. Turns out we have given up on optimization - we are doing too many requests, have too many dependencies and our files are just too large. This site is no exception. If you are running on Dialup connection or 3G speeds, or add packet loss, everything goes to hell, and most things don't even load any more. Only [blog.fefe.de](https://blog.fefe.de) soldiers on.</p>
