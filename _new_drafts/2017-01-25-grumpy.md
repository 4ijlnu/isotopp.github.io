<p>So Python is a beautiful language, which is also kind of slow. And the more cores you have, the worse it gets, because of the [GIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock)&nbsp;in the most popular implementations. Other languages are much better at concurrency, one of them supposedly being Go. So Geeks at Google have been pondering the problem, and came up with a Python-to-Go compiler called Grumpy. Read more about it [in their blog](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/01/grumpy-go-running-python.html). In rigged benchmarks it looks awesome, and under real world load it supposedly performs quite well.

Which looks like this: [![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/grumpy-247x300.png)](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/grumpy.png) &nbsp;</p>
