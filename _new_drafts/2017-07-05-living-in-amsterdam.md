<p>[Het Parool reports](http://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/minder-kleuterklassen-door-oververhitte-woningmarkt~a4504522/) on the number of children in schools in Amsterdam. Previously, pressure on Amsterdam schools inside the A10 ring has been so high that there was a lottery system in place (if you do not win, you still have to send your child to school, but it won't be a local one). During the crisis, many families looking for larger and cheaper houses outside the A10 were stuck in the city because they could not sell their homes. Now that the crisis is over, Gentrification can continue: Families go out, Expats and AirBnB move in.</p>
