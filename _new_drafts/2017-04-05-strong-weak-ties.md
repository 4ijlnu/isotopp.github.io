<p>A long time ago, I wrote a text on the German Blog and on Carta: [Wieso wir uns ver√∂ffentlichen](http://www.carta.info/41830/wieso-wir-uns-veroffentlichen/) (Why we publish ourselves). In the middle of a discussion about privacy I was explaining why people publish&nbsp;themselves, why they publicly reveal (sometimes intimate) facts about themselves. They are doing this, I wrote, to find other like-minded people, to become searchable and to become approachable, to build trust. Trust is a wonderful thing. It is the powerful assumption that most people most of the time want to help you and that falsely trying out to trust people is a recoverable mistake. Having trust and being in a trustworthy environment keeps&nbsp;transactional costs low and makes cooperation possible. And that's rewarding and awesome. How does this work in practice? <!--more--> So tomorrow there is [Pro Light and Sound in Frankfurt](http://www.messefrankfurt.com/frankfurt/en/besucher/welcome/messeveranstaltungen/messen/entertainment-media-creation/prolight_sound2017.html?nc). Sammy wants to go there, and gets the combination ticket. That's admission to the trade show, plus a ticket for German rail. That ticket is being delivered as a Bahn Tix code, which you can [punch into any German ticket machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypxepZLxff8) and get a printout. We are in the Netherlands. The next ticket machine is in Venlo. The route she's going to use does not pass Venlo. There is [no way to get Bahn Tix online](http://praxistipps.chip.de/bahntix-online-ausdrucken-geht-das_44999). I am asking on Google plus for help, and because I know at least one person following me is a Train Driver I mention them into the thread. Sammy, me and that person get into a Hangout. Ticket is being picked up and given the train driver of ICE 220 FFM -\> Amsterdam Centraal. Shift change at the border, ticket travels on to Amsterdam, +30 platform change 7b -\> 2. Printed Ticket is being successfully delivered from the engine to Sammy at 11:58. This is a direct application of&nbsp;[Interpersonal Ties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_ties)&nbsp;theory (pointing to article by [Granovetter](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/the_strength_of_weak_ties_and_exch_w-gans.pdf) (1973) and in a way to the works of [Peter Turchin](https://www.amazon.de/Ultrasociety-Years-Humans-Greatest-Cooperators/dp/0996139516). High trust societies are societies where people have [many weak ties](http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/weak_ties.htm), that can be strengthened&nbsp;as demand arises.&nbsp;It's these strong weak ties that enable (inter-) action and where cooperation wins between people are highest. In order to have strong weak ties, a society needs to have a relatively low and controlled wealth difference ([Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient)) and a working judicial system and low corruption. This creates social cohesion, and enables "random" cooperation. Also, you win friends. Looking forward to a visit, soon.</p>
