<p>[Renewable Energy World reports](http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/print/volume-20/issue-1/features/storage/energy-storage-market-outlook-2017-state-of-play.html) in an article titled "Energy Storage Market Outlook 2017" on exactly this subject. Currently there is not overly much available in terms of capacity in an Energy Storage Market, but what is there is growing very fast, with a forcast of 30GW new installation through the year of 2020, and a compount annual growth rate of 60%. </p>
<p>> For the near future, the dominant form of energy storage, pumped hydropower, is sure to remain the principal method of storing energy, occupying a global market share of over 95 percent. Aside from pumped hydro, a plethora of energy storage technologies exist with a growing number of new solutions being tried, tested and installed on a commercial basis. An even larger number reside anywhere between blueprint designs and various levels of research and development. Going forward, battery storage — of the lithium-ion variety — is expected to retain its majority market share, according to Roberts.</p>
