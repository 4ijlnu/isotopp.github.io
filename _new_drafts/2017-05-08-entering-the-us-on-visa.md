<p>The US of A have clarified what exactly they need from you to get a Visum: It's approximately everything except your passwords. [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/05/state_department_backs_down_collecting_passwords/) has a list: »</p>
<p>- Travel history during the past fifteen years, including source of funding for travel.<br />
- Address history during the past fifteen years.<br />
- Employment history during the past fifteen years.<br />
- All passport numbers and country of issuance held by the applicant.<br />
- Names and dates of birth for all siblings.<br />
- Name and dates of birth for all children.<br />
- Names and dates of birth for all current and former spouses, or civil or domestic partners.<br />
- Social media platforms and identifiers, also known as handles, used during the past five years.<br />
- Phone numbers and email addresses used during the past five years.«<br />
 People are already reacting to that [in completely expected ways](https://skift.com/2017/05/08/nationalism-threatens-to-undermine-transatlantic-travel/). <!--more--> From Chat, transcribed: </p>
<p>> Z\> I am listening to a number of US politics podcasts ATM. A number of "moderate" conservatives over there are actually lauding Trump. He might have many faults, but he actually did reduce illegal immigration. For some reason they don't understand what he does to the US as a destination for travel. He's not reducing illegal immigration, he's reducing travel overall.&nbsp;"Yes, he reduced illegal border crossings." "And legal border crossings too, numbnut." I\> False positives and their effects are a huge problem to teach, it appears. It's not just Spam ("just turn off all mail and you will never receive a single piece of spam ever again") and protection of minors. "Set everything to 18+, children and Internet do not mix." "But that won't work." "That means the problem is not marking porn as 18+, it's marking everything else as safe. But then everybody but porn producers has work, cost and liability." "But it does work with cinematic films!" "And how many free films have you been in in the last 50 years?" "..." I\> And of course the [base rate fallacy post](https://plus.google.com/+KristianK%C3%B6hntopp/posts/AbyMQm3643j). Because there are a lot more legit tourists than there are legit terrorists.</p>
<p> &nbsp; The German phrase&nbsp;ist "Selbstmord aus Angst vor dem Tod" ("Suicide for Fear of Death").</p>
