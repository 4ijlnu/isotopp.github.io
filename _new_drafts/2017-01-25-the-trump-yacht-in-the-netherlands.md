<p>The Telegraaf has an [article](http://m.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/article/27423754/krant-trump-in-makkum) (Link goes to the mobile site, b/c the real site has Adblockerblockers active) on the "Trump Princess", a ship&nbsp;that had been renovated a long time ago in a wharf in the Netherlands. [![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img-27423753-width2048height1536cq0-300x242.jpg)](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/img-27423753-width2048height1536cq0.jpg) Please note that this is about an event from the late eighties. Trump bought the "Yacht", had it refitted in the Netherlands and sold it three years later. The history of the ship is available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_5KR), and it's not particularly long by [todays standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_yachts_by_length)&nbsp;of the one percent-percenters. It's interesting, because before Trump the Yacht starred in the James Bond Movie "[Never Say Never Again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Say_Never_Again#Filming)" in a promiment role as a supervillain headquarter. A [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irsu784uiH8) Slideshow about the ship is available. Trump tried upgrading to something even larger, but that failed, says the final paragraph of an article on [Yachtharbour](https://yachtharbour.com/news/serial-yacht-owners--trump-princess-1247). In fact, he bought the [Amels](http://amels-holland.com/about-amels/the-shipyard/) shipyard in order to not complete the construction of the "Trump Princess II". Amels is a large ["Superyacht" wharf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_yachts_built_by_Amels_BV)&nbsp;near [Vlissingen](https://goo.gl/maps/Hycw9scfa7Q2). The first "Trump Princess" has been notorious, because of a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/BartMos/status/819790860006998016) from Bart Mos two weeks ago, who made a big deal of the rather tasteless interiour of this thing, which happened almost 30 years ago. He later&nbsp;[apologized](https://twitter.com/BartMos/status/819635404940935168).</p>
