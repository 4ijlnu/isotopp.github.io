<p>I\> Good Morning! M\> And to you, too!</p>
<p> I\> I hope you have a nice and technically reliable start into a new week full of hope! Kris\> Here, catch. [https://github.com/mattly/bork](https://github.com/mattly/bork) M\> »A bash DSL for config management« And it's not even chistmas, yet. I\> "the Swedish Chef Puppet of Config Management. [...] Bork is written against Bash 3.2 and common unix utilities such as sed, awk and grep. It is designed to work on any UNIX-based system and maintain awareness of platform differences between BSD and GPL versions of unix utilities. Kris\> Reinventing configure.in with root privilege! M\> When you're happy with your config script, you can compile it to a standalone script which does not require bork to run. The compiled script can be passed around M\> Like Scabies. </p>
