<p>[caption id="attachment\_1947" align="aligncenter" width="300"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Neptune_Full-300x300.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune) [Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune)[/caption] This is [Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune). It is the outermost planet of our solar system, full time or most of the time, depending on your view of the status of [Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto)&nbsp;(Pluto has a very [eccentric orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto#Relationship_with_Neptune), which partially resides closer sunward than Neptune's orbit). Neptune was discovered on 23rd Sept 1846, and [completed an entire orbit back to the point of its discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune#Orbit_and_rotation) on 2nd July 2011. Right, we know of Neptune's existence for slightly more than one Neptune-year. Also, there is a 2:3 resonance between Pluto's and Neptune's Orbit, so for 3 Neptune-years there are exactly 2 Pluto-years.</p>
