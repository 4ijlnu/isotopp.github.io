<p>[Eve Online let's us know](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/eve-online-news/new-eden-turns-14-happy-anniversary/) that it is turning 14 years old. It went live on May 6, 2003. The Iceland-based Excel-with-Lasers game is known to be highly addictive (and that's one reason why it is the prettiest game I will never be playing). Recently, Eve restructured itself so that up to a certain level players can now pilot spacecraft for free (and the free level is supposedly sufficient to see a lot of meaningful in-game action).</p>
