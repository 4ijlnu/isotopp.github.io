<p>Elektrek reports:[Daimler to convert engine production to electric at its largest factory, fewer workers required causing labor&nbsp;issues](https://electrek.co/2017/02/14/daimler-electric-vehicle-production/) According to that, the Untertürkheim Plant is going to be the place where Daimler will be developing and building their electric motors. Currently 19k people are working there, specialised in ICE building and construction. Electric motors are simpler, have less parts and are easier to construct, so less people will be needed. The transition will be challenging and structurally transformative for the whole region. &nbsp;</p>
