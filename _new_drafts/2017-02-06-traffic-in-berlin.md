<p>[caption id="attachment\_470" align="alignleft" width="150"] ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/school-patrol-150x150.jpg) Symbol picture[/caption] Earlier this year, Berliner Newspaper Der Tagesspiegel reported in&nbsp;[Berliner Grundschule kapituliert vor Rasern](http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/sicherheit-auf-dem-schulweg-berliner-grundschule-kapituliert-vor-rasern/19214140.html) (article in German) about schools in Berlin Sch√∂neberg taking down their school patrols because the job became too dangerous. Apparently parents bringing their children to schoolby car&nbsp;because traffic in Berlin is dangerous are driving so recklessly that traffic in Berlin too dangerous. Also, said parents were giving a shit about school patrols orders and signage, speed limits or other traffic rules. The saga continued with [a second article](http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/bezirke/spandau/verkehrssicherheit-in-berlin-lotsen-auch-an-spandauer-grundschule-abgezogen/19267834.html)&nbsp;(article in German) about schools in Spandau having the same problem. Because of the situation, parents instead of pupils have been employed as school patrol, but to no effect. [First reactions from politics](http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/verkehrssicherheit-in-berlin-senatorin-erwaegt-polizei-anstelle-von-schuelerlotsen/19276998.html) are in (article in German) - now the police are posting speed cams in front of schools, and are doing school patrol work in some particularly affected schools. Also, temporary road blocks (1/2 hour before school begins) are being suggested. Not just in front of schools, but throughout the city, [cycleways are often blocked](http://radzeit.de/zugeparkte-radwege-die-stadt-als-hindernisparcours/)&nbsp;(article in German, many pics)&nbsp;by parked cars in an extremely dangerous fashion.</p>
