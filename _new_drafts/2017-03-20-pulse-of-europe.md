The European pulse must be felt everywhere! We have a big goal: to gather as many people as possible in Europe, who stand for Europe, and are able to support pro- European forces after the elections. Thus we can form a human chain all across Europe connecting Germany, France and the Netherlands. **We are&nbsp;meeting every Sunday in&nbsp;several European cities: Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, KÃ¶ln, Freiburg, etc.** Check out the language versions of this website for a [full list](http://pulseofeurope.eu/poe-staedte/). The Amsterdam Group meets every Sunday, 14:00 on the lawn behind the Rijksmuseum.</p>
