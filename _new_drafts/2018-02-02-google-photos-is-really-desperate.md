<p>Google Photos offers you backup and sync, in which every crap shot you ever make is beamed into the cloud. Of course you don't want this turned on. Me neither: [caption id="attachment\_2990" align="aligncenter" width="169"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photos-1-169x300.png)](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photos-1.png) Initial Setup. Blue Slider turns grey when you turn this off.[/caption] <!--more--> Google Photos is worried when you are doing this, and asks you to reconsider: [caption id="attachment\_2991" align="aligncenter" width="169"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photos-2-169x300.png)](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photos-2.png) Yes, seriously, I want this off.[/caption] It then is worried that you are not reconsidering: [caption id="attachment\_2992" align="aligncenter" width="169"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photos-3-169x300.png)](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photos-3.png) Yes, thank you, I know. I am backing up those photos I want to share, search, enhance and organize across multiple devices manually. And certainly not all of them, thank you.[/caption] And then Photos is disappoint. Seriously. It is also even more worried than the Play Store itself if it is not current. But it's not kicking Play Store, it's kicking me: [caption id="attachment\_2993" align="aligncenter" width="169"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photos-4-169x300.png)](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photos-4.png) Yeah, so what?[/caption] This is the whiniest piece of software in a long time. Yes, this is one single flow in a reinstallation (I retriggered that by deleting all data from Photos in order to be able to document it).</p>
