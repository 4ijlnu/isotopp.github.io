<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/amsterdam-300x116.jpg)](http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2017/02/amsterdam-hits-illegal-airbnb-landlord-with-e300000-fine/) Amsterdam, like Berlin, has a housing problem. At the same time, for many owners it is more lucrative to rent out an appartment to short time renters via Airbnb than to enter a long term contract with a proper resident. The Amsterdam City Council now has hit eleven flats, all owned by the same person, with a fine of €13.500 for appartment, calling them 'the prototype of an illegal hotel'. The owner is contesting the fine. (via [DutchNews](http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2017/02/amsterdam-hits-illegal-airbnb-landlord-with-e300000-fine/) and [Het Parool](http://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/recordboete-voor-verhuur-via-airbnb~a4458612/))</p>
