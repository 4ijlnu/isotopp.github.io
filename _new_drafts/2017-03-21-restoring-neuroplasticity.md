<p>Children are learning much faster than you do. That's because as you grow up, the brain turns down Neuroplasticity to protect what you have already learned from newer, potentially harmful influence. It used to make sense. Now, how about some drugs that turn your brains ability to learn new tricks fast, on demand? [The New Scientist knows](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24831-learning-drugs-reawaken-grown-up-brains-inner-child/):</p>
<p>> Until the age of 7 or so, the brain goes through several “critical periods” during which it can be radically changed by the environment. During these times, the brain is said to have increased plasticity. […] Hensch’s team has shown that several physiological changes close the door on plasticity in animals. A key player is histone deacetylase (HDAC), an enzyme that acts on DNA and makes it harder to switch genes on or off.</p>
<p> And they used a HDAC inhibitor on humans, with considerable success.</p>
