On top of the regular traditional Async Replication shown above, they also cover SemiSync, Group Replication, and&nbsp;Galera Cluster. Statement and Row Based Replication are contrasted. Finally, "some misconceptions about replication" are being addressed, with "Replication is not a cluster", "Replication is a HA solution", "Replication replaces backups" and "Replication replaces Load Balancing".</p>
