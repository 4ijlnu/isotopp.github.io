<p>An [article in The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/02/electric-cars-cheap-solar-power-halt-fossil-fuel-growth-2020) states:</p>
<p>> Solar power and clean cars are ‘gamechangers’ consistently underestimated by big energy, says Imperial College and Carbon Tracker report. […] Big energy companies are seriously underestimating the low-carbon transition by sticking to their “business as usual” scenarios which expect continued growth of fossil fuels, and could see their assets “stranded”, the study claims.</p>
<p> They are seeing a worldwide halt in growth in demand for oil and coal by 2020. <!--more--> This is kind of echo'ed in [this article in German TV news "heute"](http://www.heute.de/verkauf-an-peugeot-citroen-gm-wird-seine-e-kompetenz-nicht-opel-ueberlassen-46629990.html)&nbsp;(article in German) about the Opel-to-PSA sale: The article still forecasts&nbsp;for 2030<br />
- 14% of all new cars as Gasoline, and<br />
- 10% of all new cars as Diesel.<br />
- 48% or new cars in 2030 are supposed to be hybrid, only<br />
- 27% pure electric.<br />
 That's kind of the opposite range of the prognosis seen in The Guardian, the slowest possible electro transition imaginable. &nbsp;</p>
