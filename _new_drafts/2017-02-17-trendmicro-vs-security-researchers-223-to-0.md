<p>[Thomas Fox-Brewster of Forbes writes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/01/25/trend-micro-security-exposed-200-flaws-hacked/#181469e55d68) on&nbsp;Roberto Suggi Liverani and Steven Seeley, which began researching the security of&nbsp;Trend Micro products last year in late July and have since today 223 weaknesses in 11 producs, 194 of them remotely exploitable. Turns out that their Data Loss Prevention tool is a lot better at Data Loss than preventing it. Most shocking for the two reseachers has been that a large number of these finds have been trivial, showing that internal code audits and software engineering practices at Trend Micro are most likely severely underdeveloped or performed only informally. Full presentation will be at [Hack in the Box](http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2017ams/sessions/trending-a-micro-line-how-we-found-over-100-rce-vulnerabilities-in-trend-micro-software/), in Amsterdam, covering TrendMicro ScanMail for Microsoft Exchange, TrendMicro Smart Protection Center, TrendMicro Data Loss Prevention, TrendMicro Control Manager, TrendMicro InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance, TrendMicro InterScan Messaging Security Suite, TrendMicro Threat Discovery Appliance, TrendMicro SafeSync, and TrendMicro Mobile Security Enterprise. &nbsp;</p>
