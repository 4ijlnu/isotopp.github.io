<p>[caption id="attachment\_2688" align="aligncenter" width="623"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/offshore-wind-farms-623x640.png)](The large scale impact of offshore windfarm structures on pelagic primary production in the southern North Sea) [The large scale impact of offshore windfarm structures on pelagic primary production in the southern North Sea](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02386)[/caption] We are going to build a lot of off-shore wind farms in the North Sea. These have often in deep water where fewer mussels and other animals live. The rotors have foundations, which essentially are forming a lot of shallower islands in the deep water, an artificial riff. This is good for mussels and other animals that like protection, shallower water and a solid base. Life in the sea is likely to become richer and more diverse.</p>
