<p>[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-25/trump-picks-unfortunate-time-to-push-for-new-u-s-auto-factories) has an article about the Car Manufacturer summit between Trump and US car manufacturers. Basically, Trump needs manufacturing jobs for the people who voted for him, but the US car industry does not look good. More than 100 plants have been closing in the US under the last two presidents, and if one would be building cars in the US, plant and product would be looking a lot like… Tesla. Which is not only defeating the point with regards to Job creation, because the plant would be mostly automated. It is also defeating [the point of all the Oil people, which have been helping Trump as well](https://thenearlynow.com/trump-putin-and-the-pipelines-to-nowhere-742d745ce8fd#.6vxh81dwf), and which very much would like to see the US not transitioning into renewables before they get out of their superheated Carbon bubble.</p>
