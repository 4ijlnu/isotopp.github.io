<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wrongstatsfront-150x150.jpg)](http://www.baekdal.com/insights/flawed-metrics-that-publishers-use-all-the-time) Matching the [Jens Scholz article](http://blog.koehntopp.info/index.php/383-how-to-read-the-internet-without-going-insane/) in german language, [Thomas Baekdal has a similar thing](http://www.baekdal.com/insights/flawed-metrics-that-publishers-use-all-the-time), pointing into a different direction, from a publishers perspective. Baekdal uses this article to focus on three metrics and assumptions that are used quite often, and how they are not helpful at all.<br />
- Engagement and Sentiment are two different things,&nbsp;and the audience that is "engaging" is self-selecting. Hence engagement metrics are flawed by construction.<br />
- All Time popularity is a weird thing, because different articles have different shapes of "engagement" over time, and that matters. So does time itself.<br />
- "Stupid but fun" articles can have good metrics, but they do not have a lot of value. If you follow the metrics, you are damaging your brand.<br />
 In general, subscribing to the&nbsp;[http://www.baekdal.com](http://www.baekdal.com)&nbsp;is a thing I would recommend.</p>
