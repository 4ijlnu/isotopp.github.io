<p>People have been asking (me of all persons) about a Security Audit for Enpass, or crowdfunding one. That is actually not the problem here. Check out [their thread](https://discussion.enpass.io/index.php?/topic/404-security-audit) on the support forum. <!--more-->A customer asks:</p>
<p>> I understand that you do not wish to open-source your product,&nbsp;but I am reluctant to use it because of the fact it is closed-source, the company is based in India (yes, this matters) and there is no information about the development team. Have you considered having an independent 3rd-party audit your source-code on a regular basis as a way to gain credibility without open-sourcing your product?</p>
<p> and answers can be found further [down here](https://discussion.enpass.io/index.php?/topic/404-security-audit/&page=2#comment-4555): </p>
<p>> We would plan for the Security Audit after the Next major release i.e. Enpass 6 as that would have a fat list of features worthy enough for security audit. Please bear with us.</p>
<p> and [with more context here](https://discussion.enpass.io/index.php?/topic/404-security-audit/&page=2#comment-4719): </p>
<p>> I truly understand concern of all you guys regarding the third party audit. But as I said in my last post that getting the third party audit&nbsp;done for the current architecture&nbsp;will no longer be useful after the next major release,&nbsp;supporting multiple vaults with new architecture. So please bear with us until the next major version is ready for our lovely users&nbsp;(under development).</p>
