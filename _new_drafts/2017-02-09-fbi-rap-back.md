<p>> The [Chinese]&nbsp;[Social Credit System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System)&nbsp;is a proposed Chinese government initiative for developing a national reputation system. It has been reported to be intended to assign a "social credit" rating to every citizen based on government data regarding their economic and social status. Xinhuanet has reported that the plan for the system "focuses on credit in four areas, including administrative affairs, commercial activities, social behavior, and the judicial system."</p>
<p> The system has been an inspiration for the Black Mirror episode [Nosedive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosedive), and US newspapers such as The Economost have been condemning it as [Digital Totalitarian State](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21711902-worrying-implications-its-social-credit-project-china-invents-digital-totalitarian). Meanwhile [The Intercepts](https://theintercept.com/2017/02/04/the-fbi-is-building-a-national-watchlist-that-gives-companies-real-time-updates-on-employees/) reports on the FBI Rap Back program ("“Rap” is an acronym for Record of Arrest and Prosecution; “Back” is short for background."), which will implement exactly this: </p>
<p>> What the program counts as “triggering events” differs depending on how subscribers configure their systems. In Missouri, where public school teachers are entered into the program, a police captain told a local paper that scanning fingerprints triggers the release of closed records, including charges that are not prosecuted and judicial decisions that result in dismissals or not guilty findings. […] Lynch said it’s possible that employees could be fired for an arrest where they were exercising their First Amendment rights: filming public officials, attending protests, blocking streets. “It’s unclear if an employer that takes action based on the arrest would know the arrest is tied to First Amendment protected activity.”</p>
