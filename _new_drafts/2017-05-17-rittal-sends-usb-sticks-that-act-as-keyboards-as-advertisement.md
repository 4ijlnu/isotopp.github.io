<p>Holger Köpke got a USB stick&nbsp;([article in German](https://plus.google.com/+HolgerKoepke/posts/anLJSX2TH73)) that supposedly is from data center equipment maker Rittal, unsolicited, in the mail. Of course he did not plug it into a device, it could be anything. He then (from his&nbsp;first comment in the same article) set up a test VM on a scratch device, inserted the USB stick there and the stick identified not as USB memory, but as a USB HID, a keyboard. Seemed that he was right not to trust it. Sends a mail to Rittal explaining them why he thinks this is dangerous, and asks if this is indeed legit. Gets a response ([another article in German](https://plus.google.com/+HolgerKoepke/posts/ZicdhMBneSC)), a letter as a PDF sent by email.<!--more--> ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rittal-response-1024x536.png)</p>
<p>> Dear Mr Köpke, first off thanks for your mail, which we are taking very seriously. We confirm that the letter in question is indeed a legit Rittal ad action. When choosing the contractor producing it we took great care to select a specialist for that. The contractor confirms that the sticks produced do not contain malware. We also checked that again, internally. To leave the user a choice of using the stick or following the link manually, it is also printed on the mailing. Again, thanks for the headsup.&nbsp;If you have more questions we are of course available. Regards…</p>
<p> There is so much to learn from all of this.</p>
