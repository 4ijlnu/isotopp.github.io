<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/secret-history-of-wonder-woman-194x300.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/Secret-History-Wonder-Woman-ebook/dp/B00PBVBLGA) One of the weirdest and most interesting characters in the DC Universe is Wonder Woman, because she is full of seemingly irreconcilable contradictions. Created by a man, [William Moulton Marston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Moulton_Marston), in 1941, her history is actually deeply rooted in the [Suffragette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffragette) movement of the early 20th century. Marston owes much of the ideas and the origin myth to earlier stories from that era and cosmos, through his wifes&nbsp; Elizabeth Holloway Marston and Olive Byrne, and through Olives Byrne's connection with Ethel Byrne and [Margaret Sanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sanger). The book is a biography of Marston, but really is a history of feminism in the United States, and also making a case that there are [no waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waves_of_feminism), but one large, meandering river. A much recommended, very unexpected find, and an eye-opening view on a bunch of unique characters, both real and imagined. "[The Secret History of Wonder Woman](https://www.amazon.de/Secret-History-Wonder-Woman-ebook/dp/B00PBVBLGA)", Jill Lepore, EUR 8.32</p>
