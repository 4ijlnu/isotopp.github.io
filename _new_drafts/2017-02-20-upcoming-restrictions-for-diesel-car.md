<p>The German Environment Help (Deutsche Umwelthilfe, DUH) apparently won a lawsuit, so the state of Bavaria will need to establish driving restrictions for Diesel cars in the Munich city center once the weather conditions will will produce a sufficient number of days where the air quality limits are being violated. EU rules require this when a certain number of days per year have happened. https://ecomento.tv/2017/02/20/muenchen-kommt-das-fahrverbot-fuer-dieselautos/</p>
