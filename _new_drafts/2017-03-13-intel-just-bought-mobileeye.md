<p>[According to Reuters](http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-intel-mobileye-idUKKBN16K0ZP), Intel just purchased Mobileye for a smooth $15.3bn. Mobileye is the Israeli company that has been suppliying hardware supported self-driving car tech to Tesla. Tesla and Mobileye parted ways earlier last year. &nbsp;</p>
