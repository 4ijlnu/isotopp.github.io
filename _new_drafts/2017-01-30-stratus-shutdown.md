<p>This is in a way the opposite of the [Windows Update Blues](http://blog.koehntopp.info/index.php/215-windows-10-update-blues/): A [Stratus computer in a steel factory in Michigan is being shut down](http://www.computerworld.com/article/3162416/data-center/booted-up-in-1993-this-server-still-runs-but-not-for-much-longer.html) after 24 years of uninterrupted, fault-free service. The machine was installed and started in 1993 (Windows 3.1, Jurassic Park), and has been running since. I did a talk about high availability solutions of various granularity as part of a computer science lecture on High Availability and Operating Systems some time back then, and Stratus as well as other coarse grained HA solutions were things papers were being written about at that time. Of course, we are doing things differently these days, and</p>
<p>> This system runs an older version Stratus proprietary VOS operating system, which Hogan believes hasn't been updated since the early 2000s.</p>
<p> is no longer an acceptable thing in todays environments. So while it works, it's still no longer viable.</p>
