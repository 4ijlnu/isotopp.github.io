<p>In our section "Ist ja bald Weihnachten…" we are looking at the [Shirtstorm](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/shirtstorm). It was in November 2014, when [Dr. Matt Taylor](https://twitter.com/mggttaylor) was celebrating the [Rosetta Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(spacecraft)) success by wearing a special T-Shirt that his friend Ellie Prizeman made for him. People not knowing him, or Ellie Prizeman took offense and Taylor was forced needlessly to apologize. The entire affair is know as [Shirtstorm](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/shirtstorm).<!--more--> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoPPgp4C9Ag Taylor&nbsp;and Prizeman&nbsp;made it through it, though. The good thing that came of it: [Ellie Prizeman's business](https://www.ellyprizeman.com/)&nbsp;today is a [great success](http://craftomoto.com/shirtstorm-fashion/), and she is making [a lot of cool&nbsp;stuff](https://twitter.com/ellypriZeMaN/status/854364174205452290). Dr. Taylor is getting still getting [awesome presents](https://twitter.com/mike_doddington/status/858115267318231040) from his friends. Also, Prizeman has a [Skeletor mug](https://twitter.com/ellypriZeMaN/status/853535307593125888). Want!</p>
