<p>Changes are coming to Chrome. Not all of them are good. For example the ability to actually view the details of a TLS certificate in Chrome has been [moved far away](http://www.howtogeek.com/292076/how-do-you-view-ssl-certificate-details-in-google-chrome/) into a hard to reach Developer menu. Most Chrome plugins&nbsp;have been disabled and removed, and the [chrome://plugins](chrome://plugins/)&nbsp;page will go away very soon (Chrome 57 and later). The remaining Plugins cannot any longer be disabled ([Bug report](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=615738#c22)).&nbsp; **This will also silently re-enable disabled plugins.** One of them is the Widevine video DRM plugin, and that is [widely seen as very problematic](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170201/14285436609/codification-web-drm-as-censorship-tool.shtml), for security and legal reasons.</p>
