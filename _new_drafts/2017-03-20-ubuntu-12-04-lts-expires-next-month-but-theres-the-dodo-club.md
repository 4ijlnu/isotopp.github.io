<p>So Precise Pangolin was published as Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on April 26, 2012. That's a long time ago. Back then,&nbsp;[Battleship, The Avengers (3D) and Cabin In The Woods (3D)](http://www.filmdetail.com/2012/01/05/uk-cinema-releases-2012/) were released. Intel released the [Ivy Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Bridge_(microarchitecture)) Microarchitecture. The last proper&nbsp;US president [campaigned for his second term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama#2012_presidential_campaign)&nbsp;and the US weren't a failed state back then. It was a different world. <!--more--> Since then, Ubuntu has seen the 12.10, 13.04, 13.10, 14.04 LTS, 14.10, 15.04, 15.10, 16.04 LTS and 16.04 releases, and the 17.04 release is due RSN. That's 10 Ubuntu releases and two of them are LTS. You should have upgraded since then. Twice. At least. If you haven't:</p>
<p>You suck. Your Devops is weak. And you should feel bad.</p>
<p> Anyway: Support for 12.04 ends in a month. If you want to join the Dodo club, though, together with the worlds remaining XP users, you can pay. Because there is the [Ubuntu 12.04 Extended Security Maintenance subscription.](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/03/14/introducing-ubuntu-12-04-esm-extended-security-maintenance/) It's Ubuntu 12.04, and it's extended and it's probably maintenance, but it certainly has nothing to do with "security". That would mean&nbsp;upgrading.</p>
