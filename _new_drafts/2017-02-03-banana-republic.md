The Japan times has a piece by Nancy Snow, titles: "[Forget Wall Street gains, U.S. soft power has crashed](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2017/01/31/commentary/world-commentary/forget-wall-street-gains-u-s-soft-power-crashed/#.WJMx4cso9nG)" and writes</p>

The emulative qualities of innovation, entrepreneurship, risk-taking and freedom are under the shadow of an executive management style directed at the “other,” whether by politics, religion, gender, national origin or institution. The persuasive abilities of the U.S. in global public opinion is at its lowest, exceeding even the civil liberty restrictions of the global war on terror.</p>
