<p>[Here](https://pepijnvloemans.wordpress.com/2017/07/08/charging-infrastructure/amp/) is the question: </p>
<p>> How much infrastructure do we need when ALL 8 million vehicles (and buses and trucks!) in the Netherlands go electric? The answer will surprise you: we could get to 100% electric transportation in the Netherlands, just by converting the 4000 existing gast stations to fast charging stations which have an average of 14 fast chargers.</p>
<p> The article then plays with numbers a bit: Kilometers driven, electricity used, number of chargepoints, charging rates.</p>
