<p> ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/european-flag-150x150.gif) The [European Union has a press release](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/de/news-room/20170207IPR61510/accessing-online-films-and-tv-while-abroad-deal-with-council), in which they say fee based online services will have to abandon IP-based access limitations: </p>
<p>> The new rules will remove these restrictions for all new subscriptions and also for those purchased before the rules enter into force, thus enabling EU citizens to access this online content while temporarily abroad in another EU country on holiday, for studies or for business.</p>
<p> That will not remove the ability to establish licensing deals with units smaller than all of the EU, though. The IP-based geoblocks are instead being replaced with other blocks. </p>
<p>> The agreed legislation will allow online content service providers to take “reasonable and proportionate measures” to verify the EU country of residence of the subscriber. A closed list of permitted verification methods includes checks on electronic identification, payment details, public tax information, postal address details or IP address checks. Service providers will be required to inform customers of the verification methods used and take appropriate security measures to protect their data.</p>
