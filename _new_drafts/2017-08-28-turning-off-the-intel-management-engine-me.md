<p>[Over at Positive Technologies](http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2017/08/disabling-intel-me.html), we learn: </p>
<p>> Our team of Positive Technologies researchers has delved deep into the internal architecture of Intel Management Engine (ME) 11, revealing a mechanism that can disable Intel ME after hardware is initialized and the main processor starts. In this article, we describe how we discovered this undocumented mode and how it is connected with the U.S. government's High Assurance Platform (HAP) program.</p>
<p> Yup, the NSA is running Intel machines with the ME off, and so should you, most likely.</p>
