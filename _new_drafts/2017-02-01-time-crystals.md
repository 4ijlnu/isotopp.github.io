<p>A crystal is a regular, repeating structure of matter in space. What if we made a regular, repeating structure in time instead?</p>
<p>> Wilczek countered that a time crystal was more akin to a superconductor, in which electrons flow with no resistance, and in theory could do so forever without the need to add energy to the system. In a time crystal, electrons would travel in a loop rather than a line and occasionally bunch up rather than flow smoothly, repeating in time the way atoms in ordinary crystals repeat in space.</p>
<p>[Jennifer Ouelette writes in New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2119804-worlds-first-time-crystals-cooked-up-using-new-recipe/) that this is indeed not just theoretically possible, but has been done, and could be maybe useful to built better quantum computers.</p>
