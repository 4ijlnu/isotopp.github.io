<p> ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tesla-150x150.jpg)Five&nbsp;operators of fast charge networks for electric vehicles &nbsp;in six european countries just announced to cooperate, [reports electrek](https://electrek.co/2017/02/07/electric-vehicle-charging-networks-europe/), creating a unified network of more than 500 fast chargers. Operators are Fastned (Netherlands), Sodetrel (France), Smatrics (Austria), Gr√∏nn Kontakt (Norway) and GOtthard FASTcharge (Switzerland). Notably absent, Germany. The alliance will establish bilateral roaming agreements between themselves, allowing drivers that are members of one network to charge in all of these networks.</p>
