<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/EValusation-189x300.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.rub.enesys.evaluation) [EValuation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.rub.enesys.evaluation) is an app on the Play Store. It records your daily driving over some time creating a usage profile. The app then lists which electric cars would fit your profile. The app costs 1.49 EUR. It does not correlate with public transport, but that's easily done manually with the profiles created.</p>
