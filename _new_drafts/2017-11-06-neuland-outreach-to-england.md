<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wontreach-openreach-300x169.jpg)](BT Openreach van effigy set alight by frustrated villagers) [The BBC has an article](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-41876557) about the good people of Templeton, Devon burning an effigy of an BT Openreach van over frustration with slow broadband speeds. The villagers say they were promised superfast broadband three years ago, but are still waiting, because BT says it's the wrong kind of rural environment to put connectivity into. Templeton, which is in England where Freiburg would be in Germany, is getting all of&nbsp;0.7 megabits per second.</p>
