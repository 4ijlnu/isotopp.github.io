Which is all nice and fine, as long as the gadgets work and are sitting firm and rattle-free, and as long as you don't have to do maintenance on any parts. One of the gadgets available is a GPS tracker with Internet connectivity, which obviously is sufficient to call this thing a "smart" bike. VanMoof promotes this, and their bikes, with bike-retrieval-as-a-service, where a VanMoof employee tries to get stolen bikes back using the information from the tracking device. These stories are being used&nbsp;for marketing purposes in their newly started series "[The VanMoof Bike Hunter](https://medium.com/vanmoof/yesterday-we-chased-a-bike-thief-from-paris-to-brussels-263e9f3a92f4#.c05sthyv0)".</p>
