[Another news outlet](http://www.journal-news.com/news/data-from-man-pacemaker-led-arson-charges/sDp2XXGPY1EKJkY57sureP/) reports »“A cardiologist who reviewed that data determined ‘it is highly improbable Mr. Compton would have been able to collect, pack and remove the number of items from the house, exit his bedroom window and carry numerous large and heavy items to the front of his residence during the short period of time he has indicated due to his medical conditions.'”« The retrieved data helped to indict Comption, who also had gasoline on various pieces of his clothing.</p>
