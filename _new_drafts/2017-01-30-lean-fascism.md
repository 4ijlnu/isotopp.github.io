<p>Translated from German, [original Text](https://www.facebook.com/nicolas.katte/posts/10206562544061873) by Nicolas Katte:</p>
<p> It's " **lean fascism**", and that's how it works: Political positions are no longer backed by theory and no longer subject to political discourse and societal control. They are simply being implemented, sometimes even purposefully badly crafted, in order to measure societal reaction. The goal of the "Machiavellian Blitzkrieg" which we have been witnessing in the last few days regarding Executive Orders, Planned Parenthood and&nbsp;Muslim Ban is not a single big change. It tries to port&nbsp;the principles of the [Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898) to politics: Trying to find a path to a goal through tight feedback loops between the island of planning (a company or the government) and the chaotic reaction (the market, or society). **Each executive order is like a minimum viable product: it looks like a law, and is being applied for the first few hours like a law, the reaction of society toward it is being measured as if it was a law.** Which offices, which NGOs and which individuals are willing to accept this order, even if it is a violation of the constitution? Who resists? Is the resistance inside the law (e.g. by calling on the rule of law or the constitution) or outside, through protests, organisation or by breaking the law? The reactions of lawyers and governmental organisations, the Tweets and Facebook posts of all people are being collected and a detailed breakdown of moods and political posture is being created. Of course lists are being updated, maybe even with a score per individual, tracking the change in approval and rejection over time for individuals and organisations. Is the opposition becoming tired, are they worn out? Protest is part of the plan in the early stages, because just as the positions of Trump initially have been seen as extreme and became normalized over time, protest will be seen as normal over time and find less and less attention. Also, while masses are demonstrating the "muslim ban" it's easy to change the complete staff of the state department and install your own people instead. **Activities of political opponents as seen from a position of political power are not seen as an opposition to the implementation of the one single policy. Instead each activity of the opposition is seen as a small experiment that is an opportunity to learn and to change.** At the same time it keeps the opposition busy while one quietly takes control of the next office of the state.<br />
