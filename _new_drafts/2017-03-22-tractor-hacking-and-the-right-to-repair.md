<p>[Vice Motherboard has an article](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware) about US farmers hacking their John Deere tractors, because the software in the machinery comes with very limiting conditions. </p>
<p>> To avoid the draconian locks that John Deere puts on the tractors they buy, farmers throughout America's heartland have started hacking their equipment with firmware that's cracked in Eastern Europe and traded on invite-only, paid online forums.[…] "If things could get better, [companies like John Deere] should be forced to freely distribute the same software dealers have,"&nbsp;they said.&nbsp;"And stop locking down [Engine Control Module] reading functionality. They do this to force you to use their services, which they have a 100 percent&nbsp;monopoly on."[…] "What happens in 20 years when there's a new tractor out and John Deere doesn't want to fix these anymore?" the farmer using Ukrainian software told me. "Are we supposed to throw the tractor in the garbage, or what?"</p>
