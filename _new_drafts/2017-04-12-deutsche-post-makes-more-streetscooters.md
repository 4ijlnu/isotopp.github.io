So they teamed up with StreetScooter Aachen, later purchased the company. Their vehicles: electric bikes for loads up to 50kg, and the "Work" parcel delivery car. Both have been an unmitigated success, and StreetScooter was swamped with requests from other companies having similar needs. End Result: doubled production capacity (20k per year), new factory in NRW, Germany, selling vehicles to third parties due to high demand, and a new Scooter, Work L, with double the load. The full fleet is expected to cover all urban delivery needs, from e-bikes through e-trikes, to electric vans with 4, 8 and 20 cbm transport capacity. Deutsche Post plans to be completely emissions free in 2050.</p>
