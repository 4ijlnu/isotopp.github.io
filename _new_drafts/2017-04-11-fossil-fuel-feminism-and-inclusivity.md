<p>The Koch Brothers are highly invested into hydrocarbons and desperately need more time to get out of their investment while the world is switching to renewables. So how desperate are they, exactly? Think Progress [has a money quote](https://thinkprogress.org/koch-backed-group-celebrates-fossil-fuels-425ca28de8da):</p>
<p>> Cooke told ThinkProgress that the organization’s fossil fuels art contest is rooted in inclusivity. “Fossil fuels seem to get left out of the Earth Day celebration,” she said via email. “As an energy feminist — pro-choice in energy sources — I feel it’s important to have hydrocarbons equally represented.”</p>
<p> As a friend put it: »If she's delivering this with a straight face, she's worth every cent of her salary as a PR-woman.« (via [Florian](https://twitter.com/xahteiwi/status/851760930732072961))</p>
