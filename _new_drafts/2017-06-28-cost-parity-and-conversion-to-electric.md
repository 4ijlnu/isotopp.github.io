<p>[caption id="attachment\_2007" align="alignleft" width="150"] ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Logistic-curve.svg_-150x150.png) [Sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Logistic-curve.svg)[/caption] This is the Sigmoid or Logistic Curve. It describes capped expontially growing things, like [cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function#In_medicine:_modeling_of_growth_of_tumors) or the [takeup of new technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function#In_economics_and_sociology:_diffusion_of_innovations). So, yes, electric cars are in a way like Cancer. :-) The point being that right now a lot of people are waiting for electric cars to take really off. Right now, they are in the low single digit numbers of the total car population, but when a certain breaking point is being reached, that will change very extremely quickly. Many people think this breaking point is cost parity, electric cars costing approximately as little or much as a comparable car with ICE. And some people are bullish and think [that year might even be 2018](https://www.treehugger.com/cars/electric-cars-will-cost-same-conventional-cars-early-next-year.html). The thing being that, in order to satisfy sudden demand, you need to have building capacity and enough experience to have the processes down and ready for mass manufacture. Well, maybe it's not 2018, but 2020. In any case, time is running out for makers of cars with ICE.</p>
