<p>IKEA is experimenting with furniture that has wooden click fittings instead of screws. »We believe that easy assembly will be important for IKEA and our customers. When we were kids, we built treehouses. Today, kids grow up with a phone in their hands. It doesn't come as natural to them to assembly furniture with a screwdriver.« https://player.vimeo.com/video/173273804</p>
