<p>EU Observer [reports](https://euobserver.com/dieselgate/136657) on a five page internal note from the EU&nbsp;director-general at the commission's internal market and industry department:</p>
<p>> "Absolute NOx emissions of diesel vehicles under real driving conditions have hardly changed” despite “various” EU “steps”. “On the road, a Euro 5 vehicle emits almost the same amount of NOx per km as a Euro 3 vehicle."</p>
<p> The testing method, which is nothing like real road conditions, is mentioned as a contributing factor.</p>
