<p>An electric bike, of all things, in a shop for e-Bikes in the basement level of a parking structure in Hannover caught fire. The fire was extremely smoky, and completely engulfed the parking structure. It had to be evacuated. The bike shop was completely destroyed, the parking structure has been desmoked and is cleared for use again. Apparently a battery exploded, and hot smelter created fire in multiple locations in the shop, which then propagated before it could be extinguished. The fire department was on place with more than 70 people and 30 engines, took over an hour to bring the fire under control.
