<p>[Article in the FAZ](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/schulverbot-wegen-masern-gefahr-in-frankfurt-14756549.html)&nbsp;(article in german):&nbsp;Two&nbsp;pupils attending&nbsp;a Gymnasium in Frankfurt got the measles. The vaccination records of 800 pupils are being checked. Youths without vaccination are being banned from attending school for safety reasons. 2016, 14 cases of measles have been registered in 2016, down from 70+ the year before. [One girl&nbsp;died from complications](http://www.spiegel.de/gesundheit/diagnose/masern-sechsjaehriges-maedchen-stirbt-in-hessen-an-spaetfolgen-a-1123060.html)&nbsp;(article in german), effectively&nbsp;killed by her parents denying her vaccination. Measles viruses can attack brain cells, and if the sickness progresses to that stage, it is always deadly. Vaccination helps.</p>
