<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh2exzwVAc I am generally quite fond of [/r/the\_schulz](https://www.reddit.com/r/the_schulz/), and how they are taking all the toxic memes and strategies of the American Nazi Movement and are turning them around to Make Europe Great Again, that is, putting some Emotions into the idea of the European Union. And this here is seriously awesome.</p>
