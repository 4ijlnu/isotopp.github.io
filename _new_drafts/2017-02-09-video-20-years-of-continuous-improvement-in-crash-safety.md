<p>Continual improvement is sometimes hard to see, because each iteration, each incremental step itself is tiny so that the actual change escapes our attention. Also, just living our lives, our time sense is sometimes distorted. Me for example, I was almost 30 already in the late Nineties, and while that is already 20 years ago, it feels like yesterday to me. So car safety in the Nineties, compared to now? It was crap. Check this out: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pwGgRUkrnng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> We do learn, and things do get better. Change is not radical, most of the time it's evolutionary. And to make it visible, you have to look really hard and contract now and then.</p>
