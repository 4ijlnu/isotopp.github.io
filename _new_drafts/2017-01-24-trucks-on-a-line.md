<p>[Heise](https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Elektromobilitaet-Praxistest-von-Oberleitungs-Lkw-auf-zwei-Strecken-ab-Ende-2018-3605961.html)&nbsp;says: For long distance good transport Germany will test electrified lorries withpantographs and catenaries running on pieces of Autobahn in Hessen and&nbsp;Schleswig-Holstein as a proof of concept. The trucks are supposed to draw power from the catenary and must be able to drive the last mile on their own power. The illustration mentions hybrid cars, the text speaks about Diesel engines _and_ a small battery. If the last mile is short enough (acutally up to 100km), it's in principle possible to buy purely electric trucks. The truck could recharge while driving on the Autobahn, and then use that power after going off the line into the city.
