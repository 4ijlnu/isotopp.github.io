<p>[Klimaretter interview with Tobias Kurth](http://www.klimaretter.info/energie/hintergrund/22645-bei-sonne-und-wind-droht-abschalten)&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy Brainpool, quite long. They are going through multiple scenarios how renewable energy can develop in Germany, and how then will develop Germany in turn. We are having an interesting mix of constraints. On the one hand highly variable energy sources such as wind and solar are being built out, on the other hand stabilizers such as batteries in cars and hosues are entering the market. The power network is becoming more decentralized, and individual producers/consumers are going partially autonomous. Energy is being transported more, and over distances. Kurth's cornerstomes are the three D's, decarbonizing, decentralisation and digitalisation.</p>
