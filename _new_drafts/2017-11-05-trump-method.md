<p>[caption id="attachment\_2754" align="aligncenter" width="640"] ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/starships-640x435.png) [Starships:](http://store.steampowered.com/app/282210/Sid_Meiers_Starships/) They give up, how frustrating.[/caption] Supremacy, Kozlov, Epic, 6 Opponents, Moderate, All victories. Zero Science planets, but one world with constantly rising city count. I am building everything there, and start a secondary Metals world and lacking Science, an Energy world, too. Elodie (Yellow) almost dies early in the game and goes nowhere. Hutama (Orange) throws the towel and joins Kavitha (Red) of all teams. So do Barre (Green) and finally Elodie, too. Due to the Energy flood I am having a fleet of 8x 400HP heavies with Plasmas and heavy Armor, Science on Armor and Plasma, too. I get bored and invade Kavitha, negotiate, get 13k Metals, build wonders, and _immediately declare war on Kavitha again_, invade, negotiate, get 11k Science, science it into Plasma improvements, _immediately declare war again_, invade, negotiate, get another 11k metals, and build more wonders. With my own Metals that's a 65k Metals round, and a Wonder Victory. Ok, I guess that's one way to do it.</p>
