<p>Actually, the election was broken before, and the Chaos Computer Club [just happened to be the only one looking closely enough](http://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2017/pc-wahl), again. ([German PDF](https://ccc.de/system/uploads/230/original/PC-Wahl_Bericht_CCC.pdf)) Ten years ago, they broke the digital elections in Hamburg, which were to be based on the [Digitaler Wahlstift](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitaler_Wahlstift). Because of that, and [Wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wij_vertrouwen_stemcomputers_niet) there is actually a completely offline paper record that can be used to rebuild election results from hand. So this time CCC looked at the electrion result collection and tabulation software, PC-Wahl 10. And found something uses default passwords of the calibre test/test, using FTP based unsigned software updates, and using no secure way whatsoever to transmit and validate election results.</p>
<p>> „Elementary principles of IT-security were not heeded to. The amount of vulnerabilities and their severity exceeded our worst expectations“, says Linus Neumann, a speaker for the CCC that was involved in the study.</p>
<p> If there is ever a valid use case for the BlockchainMerkel [Merkle Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree), it's probably this.</p>
