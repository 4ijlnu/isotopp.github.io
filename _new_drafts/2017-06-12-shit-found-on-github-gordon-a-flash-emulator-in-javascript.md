<p>[Gordon](https://github.com/tobytailor/gordon) is&nbsp;an open source Flash™ runtime written in pure JavaScript. </p>
<p>> Gordon lets you run your SWF movie files in a JavaScript based environment, without the need of any plugins or additional software. It takes advantage of the latest web technologies like SVG to render vector based graphics or Web Workers for enhanced performance and to parse even large SWF’s in the background, without blocking the user interface. Furthermore, it gives you full access and control of the resources, characters and timeline behaviours in your movie via JavaScript or DOM scripting.</p>
<p> Because Flash alone is not toxic enough. You need to put JS on top. Also, my battery drains faster than yours. via Lutz Donnerhacke.</p>
