<p>When dealing with Kubernetes, you will inevitably have to deal with config and data that is in JSON format. [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) is a cool tool to handle this, but&nbsp;while the man page is complete, it is also very dry. A [nice tutorial](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/json-and-jq) can be found at The Programming Historian, which uses some real world use cases. My personal use case is [Converting JSON to CSV](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32960857/how-to-convert-arbirtrary-simple-json-to-csv-using-jq), and the [inverse of that](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki/Cookbook#convert-a-csv-file-with-headers-to-json). There also is a mildly interesting [FAQ](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki/FAQ). Learning jq takes about one quiet afternoon of time.</p>
