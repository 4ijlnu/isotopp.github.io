<p>According to [an article in The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15365572/google-ad-blocking-feature-chrome-browser), Google is rumored to implement native adblocking in Chrome.</p>
<p>> The option would be opt-in, and it would remove any and all “unacceptable” ads as defined by Coalition for Better Ads industry group. Those types of ads include pop-up ads, autoplay videos, and what are known as prestitial ads, or those ads that are often fullscreen and show up before you’re taken to the homepage or desired website.</p>
<p> The majority of web users have installed adblockers by now, and adblockers have been increasingly recognized as a malware fighting tool, preventing drive-by exploits by targeted malvertising. Native Adblocking would be a good way for Google to control the agenda, and to push the Coalition for Better Ads style of advertising - a way for the advertising industry to reign in the wild-west style of user profiling, malvertising, and generally making web browing a bad experience. This is definitively a step into the right direction, but too little, too late. &nbsp;</p>
