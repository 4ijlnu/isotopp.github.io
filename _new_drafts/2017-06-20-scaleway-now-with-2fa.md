<p>Cloud Provider Scaleway now has ARM64 based bare metal in Amsterdam. They are also [now offering 2FA auth](https://blog.online.net/2017/06/13/introducing-two-factor-authentication-on-scaleway/) based on Google Authenticator (or other, compatible 2FA apps). No U2F token support, yet, though (but still a better solution than steam). This blog is hosted on a Scaleway instance.</p>
