<p>[Perlito5](http://blogs.perl.org/users/flavio_s_glock/2017/05/perl5-to-java-compiler---first-release.html) is an experimental Perl to Java compiler by Flavio Glock. It is work-in-progress. </p>
<p>> It provides an impressive coverage of Perl features, but it will not run most existing Perl programs due to platform differences.</p>
<p> It is still pretty nifty. &nbsp;</p>
