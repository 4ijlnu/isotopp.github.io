<p>[caption id="attachment\_1055" align="alignleft" width="300"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/unix-haters-handbook.jpg)](http://www.vbcf.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/BioComp/training/unix_haters_handbook.pdf) [Unix Haters Handbook](http://www.vbcf.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/BioComp/training/unix_haters_handbook.pdf) (PDF)[/caption] Back in the day, when I was a very little Kris, trying to understand this Unix thing, there have been quite a number of pointers to the UNIX Haters Handbook ([PDF](http://www.vbcf.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/BioComp/training/unix_haters_handbook.pdf), [print](https://www.amazon.de/Unix-Haters-Handbook-Book-Barf-Bag/dp/1568842031)) by Garfinkel et al. The uninteresting part of the book complains about the world not adopting the Symbolics LISP machine and development environment as a standard (obviously a nonsensical and short-sighted idea), the other pointed to a number of shortcomings and inconsistencies in the Unix concept and implementation.<!--more--> On the other hand, all new ideas and operating systems or APIs are doing thing first just after they manage to bootstrap an environment: They implement a UNIX API or compatibility layer. Rob Pike wrote about this in [Systems Software Research is Irrelevant](http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/utah2000/utah2000.html). Another version of the same rant, slightly modernized, can be found in&nbsp;[The Collapse of the UNIX Philosophy](https://kukuruku.co/post/the-collapse-of-the-unix-philosophy/), which like the Haters Handboook, mostly confuses Unix, Unix API issues, C issues and implementation deficiencies in distinct implementations, which severely obscures any point the text is trying to make. Still, I agree - Unix sucks. It's just that everything else sucks more.</p>
