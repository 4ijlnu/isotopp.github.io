<p>The [Juno Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)) is flying by [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter) right now, producing [tons of wonderful images](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam/processing?phases[]=PERIJOVE+7), of the planet and it's [red spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot), a raging superstorm three times the size of our planet, that has been going since we can observe it.
