<p> ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/battery-price.jpg) Kittner, Lill and Kammen made use of a model [similar to the one for PV pricing](http://blog.koehntopp.info/index.php/2372-the-story-of-co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions/)&nbsp;in their Paper [Energy storage deployment and innovation for the clean energy transition](https://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy2017125) ([PDF](https://sci-hub.cc/https://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy2017125)) to model and predict pricing for batteries. </p>
<p>> A deeply decarbonized energy system research platform needs materials science advances in battery technology to overcome the intermittency challenges of wind and solar electricity. […] Here we analyse deployment and innovation using a two-factor model that integrates the value of investment in materials innovation and technology deployment over time from an empirical dataset covering battery storage technology. […] We find and chart a viable path to dispatchable US$1 W−1 solar with US$100 kWh−1 battery storage that enables combinations of solar, wind, and storage to compete directly with fossil-based electricity options.</p>
