<p>[phys.org tells us:](https://m.phys.org/news/2017-01-source-asymmetry-antimatter.html)&nbsp;New source of asymmetry between matter and antimatter [caption id="attachment\_342" align="aligncenter" width="640"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/newsourceofa.jpg)](https://m.phys.org/news/2017-01-source-asymmetry-antimatter.html) LHCb sees where the antimatter's gone<br />
ALICE looks at collisions of lead ions[/caption] So we are made from matter, and not from anti-matter. In fact, anti-matter can be made, but is pretty hard to find. Why is that? <!--more--> You remember of course this: <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j50ZssEojtM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> and the lyrics: </p>
<p>> LHCb sees where the antimatter's gone ALICE looks at collisions of lead ions CMS and ATLAS are two of a kind They're looking for whatever new particles they can find The LHC accelerates the protons and the lead And the things that it discovers will rock you in the head</p>
<p> Well, turns out that LHCb did it's thing: They seem to have found evidence of a CP violation in baryons (Protons and Electrons). So the laws of nature seem to be not identical for Matter and Anti-Matter, and the difference seems to be pretty large. So far the finding stands with a StdDev of 3.3 (5.0 needed for the result to be "valid"), so the finding is tentative, but if it can be confirmed that is big.
