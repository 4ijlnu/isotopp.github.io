<p>So I started this blog after being a long time "Google+ only" publisher, and now GDPR is coming. I have looked into making this wordpress instance GDPR compliance, but it's no fun. The webfonts are easy, but "no more Youtube embeds without a consent orgy" is no fun, and losing the Google/Facebook/Twitter SSO integration will basically lose all mobile users (80% or so of all readers). The easiest way to get GDPR compliance is to move back to Google+ only, or to move this blog to wordpress.com or to medium.com. What migration target do you prefer (running a self-hosted instance is not an option for me after May, 25)?<!--more-->[Migration to Medium](https://mustapha.me/how-i-moved-my-wordpress-blogs-to-medium-and-kept-my-domains-7433a6cad88) instructions [Migration to Wordpress.com](https://en.support.wordpress.com/moving-from-self-hosted-wordpress-to-wordpress-com/) instructions JÃ¼rgen Geuter nails it ([german article on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/JGeuter/posts/10211611505868513)): Self-Hosted anything after GDPR is only for people with a really good legal expenses insurance.</p>
