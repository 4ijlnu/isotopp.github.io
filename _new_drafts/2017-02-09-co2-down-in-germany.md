<p> ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tesla-150x150.jpg) [ecomento reports](https://ecomento.tv/2017/02/07/co2-emissionen-in-deutschland-ruecklaeufig-trotz-mehr-co2-im-verkehr/)&nbsp;(article in German)&nbsp;the amount of CO2 emissions in Germany are very slightly down (actually 0.3% less than last year are more like stable), despite more CO2 emissions due to traffic. On the other hand, we are down almost 28% compared to 1990, so there is actual progress. Savings are mostly in the energy production sector, the German Energiewende actually works. The savings are eaten up by traffic, because Germany is way behind when it comes to electric mobility.</p>
