They write:</p>
<p>> China has been the world’s largest manufacturer of solar panels since 2008 and has over 400 PV companies. It is now the largest market for both photovoltaics and solar thermal energy. In 2013, it was the world’s leading installer of solar photovoltaics, and by mid-2015 had reached a total installed capacity of 35.78 GW, making it the largest producer of PV power. In 2015, China installed over 18 GW, reaching a total of 43 GW.</p>
<p> Like Germany, China has problems scaling the grid to match, and [idle capacity is a problem](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-20/out-of-china-s-dusty-northwest-corner-a-solar-behemoth-arises).</p>
