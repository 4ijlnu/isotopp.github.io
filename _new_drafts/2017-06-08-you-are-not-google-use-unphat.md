<p>[You are not Google](https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/you-are-not-google-84912cf44afb): Ozan Onay suggests to UNPHAT:</p>
<p>> Next time you find yourself Googling some cool new technology to (re)build your architecture around, I urge you to stop and follow **UNPHAT** instead:</p>
<p>1. </p>
<p>> Don’t even start considering solutions until you **Understand** the problem. Your goal should be to “solve” the problem mostly within the _problem_ domain, not the solution domain.</p>
<p>2. </p>
<p>> **eNumerate** multiple candidate solutions. Don’t just start prodding at your favorite!</p>
<p>3. </p>
<p>> Consider a candidate solution, then read the **Paper** if there is one.</p>
<p>4. </p>
<p>> Determine the **Historical context** in which the candidate solution was designed or developed.</p>
<p>5. </p>
<p>> Weigh **Advantages** against disadvantages. _Determine what was de-prioritized_ to achieve what _was_ prioritized.</p>
<p>6. </p>
<p>> **Think!** Soberly and humbly ponder how well this solution fits your problem. _What fact would need to be different for you to change your mind?_ For instance, how much smaller would the data need to be before you’d elect _not_ to use Hadoop?</p>
