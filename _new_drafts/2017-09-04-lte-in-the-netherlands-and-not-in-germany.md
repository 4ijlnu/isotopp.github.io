<p>Try to find Germany on the [OpenSignal Charts](https://opensignal.com/reports/2017/06/state-of-lte). Hint: It's behind Tunisia. The #tvduell spent hours and hours on foreign policy and almost nothing on education, network and politics and other, future related topics. Germany is living in a past, basically in the 80ies. And that past is being left behind, fast.[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/neuland-640x423.jpg)](https://opensignal.com/reports/2017/06/state-of-lte)</p>
