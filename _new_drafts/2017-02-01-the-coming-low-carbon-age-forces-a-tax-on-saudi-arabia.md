<p>[The Guardian reports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/31/saudi-arabia-tax-approved-oil-revenues-slump) on the first time ever a tax is levvied after the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>> Residents of the energy-rich region had long enjoyed a tax-free and heavily subsidised existence but the collapse in crude prices since 2014 sparked cutbacks and a search for new revenue.</p>
<p> They will now get a 5% sales tax on certain good, and that is the result of chronically low crude oil prices. The 2016 budget of Saudi Arabia had a deficit of almost 100 billion dollars, and the government goal is to have a balanced budget by 2020.</p>
