<p>So [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05742) operates on the premise that there is a high security installation. Because of that it has an isolated network, and also physical protection, in the form of common cameras with the ubiquitous IR lighting. Turns out, so the developers of "[aIR-Jumper](http://cyber.bgu.ac.il/advanced-cyber/airgap)", you can code data into flashes of IR camera lights, and you can read input using the security cameras. So after the initial infection (which would have to take an different route) you can talk to your implant using the security features of the isolated network. <!--more--> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auoYKSzdOj4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om5fNqKjj2M</p>
