<p>GM is considering one of two strategies: Giving up and selling the Opel Brand to Peugot, or going all-in electric cars, with the sell-off being more likely. Selling off Opel would likely kill the Ampera, though. Being deep into the red for many years, Opel does not have the resources to do both, develop electric cars and new models with ICE, says CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann [in an article in Automotive News](http://www.autonews.com/article/20170215/COPY01/302159965/1221). The purported end-date for ICE cars at Opel is weird, though, because they speak about 2030. That's actually quite late, considering that Smart is ending ICE variants in North America and Norway this year. &nbsp;</p>
