<p>The [German Tank Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_tank_problem) describes a method to statistically sample serial numbers of German WW2 tanks in order to estimate German War production capacity. The [Bloomberg Tesla Model 3 Tracker](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/) does use this method applied to vehicle identification numbers issued and observed to create upper and lower boundaries on the current weekly production rate for the Tesla Model 3. This week it is 1052.</p>
