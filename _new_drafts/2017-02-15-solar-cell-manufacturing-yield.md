<p> ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Figs_forMITEI-2-figB-right-150x150.png) [The MIT is reporting on its own research](http://energy.mit.edu/news/advanced-silicon-solar-cells/), trying to explain why certain high-efficiency solar modules are losing efficiency after a few months of operation The difference seems to be in the manufacturing process, in which lower temperatures during firing and keeping out certain impurities seems to reflect favourably on the stability of the produced cells. Getting higher yield and better long-term stability is key to achieving cheaper solar modules, which will in turn lead to cheaper electricity from sustainable sources. </p>
