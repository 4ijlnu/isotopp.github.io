<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ksr-new-york-2140-197x300.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/York-2140-English-Stanley-Robinson-ebook/dp/B01M065XX5) New in the SUB: Kim Stanley Robinson imagines a submerged New York in the year 2140. After the sea level rose in multiple increments of three meters, the world change, and so did New York. It didn't die, though. It just changed. Told from the viewpoint of different characters with differing levels of privilege and different interests, the real star of the story is the City. "New York 2140", Kim Stanley Robinson ([Kindle](https://www.amazon.de/York-2140-English-Stanley-Robinson-ebook/dp/B01M065XX5))</p>
