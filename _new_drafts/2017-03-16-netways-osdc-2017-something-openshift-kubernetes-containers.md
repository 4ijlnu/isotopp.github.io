At work, we are currently busy loading our first two Kubernetes Clusters (Openshift actually) with workloads. What exactly will be in the slides I do not know, yet, but it will be about our journey at Booking, the transition from automated baremetal provisioning of rather monolithic applications to a more containerized setup and the changes and challenges this brings. It will be very much a snapshot of the state of things at that point in time, and our learnings and perspective then. ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-16-at-13.44.13.png)</p>
