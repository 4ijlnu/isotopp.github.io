<p>> Sadly, we have to inform you that we decided to cancel the conference due to the current political situation in the USA. Our hearts are bleeding, but we believe it is the right thing to do. The Agile Testing Days (ATDs) stand for diversity, openness, respect and support the observance of human rights. We despise any sort of hostility or harassment. The behavior of the current US Government Authority is unacceptable for us and against our values and views. As international organizers we also aim at a diverse and international conference crowd â€“ audience and speakers alike. Many people of the community are expressing their concerns, and even speakers are withdrawing from their attendance now. All of them feel unconfident about the next months and are unsure of potential problems when entering the country, including us as organizers.</p>
<p> I am waiting for their announcement of an alternate Venue in Cancun.</p>
