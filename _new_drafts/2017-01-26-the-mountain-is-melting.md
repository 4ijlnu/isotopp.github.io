<p>Swiss magazine Blick [reports](http://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/westschweiz/wegen-gletscherschmelze-bergstation-moosfluh-stellt-betrieb-ein-id5622419.html) that the Moosfluthbahn up to the Aletsch glacier is out of operation, because the&nbsp;glacier is melting under it. The station is brand new, and went into operation only last year. [![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/News-BergbahnAletsch1-300x169.jpg)](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/News-BergbahnAletsch1.jpg)The station up at the glacier&nbsp;had been constructed with the glacier melting in mind: It sits inside a concrete tub which can be righted with hydraulics. Engineering calculations have been made assuming 9 meters of movement in 25 years. The actual measured movement has been up to 0.7 meters per day, though. The glacier is melting very rapidly, making the ground unstable. Similar things are happening all over the Alps.</p>
