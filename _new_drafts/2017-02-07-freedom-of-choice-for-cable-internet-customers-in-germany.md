<p> ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/rj45-150x150.jpg) Fall 2015 saw a change of law in Germany: Just as with DSL customers, Cable Internet customers got freedom of choice. Their provider has to tell them usernames, passwords and other required config information so that they are able to purchase a router of their choice and configure that itself, instead of being forced to use the customer premises equipment (CPE) provided by the cable company. The wording of the law, "bei Vertragsschlu√ü" (at the time of signing), could be read that this rule is only for new customers, not for existing customers. Some cable providers offered the passwords to all their customers, but others didn't. A customer of Gelsen-Net sued for the information, and won - the judge basically said that the law obviously wants all customers to have this freedom of choice, or it would be useless.
