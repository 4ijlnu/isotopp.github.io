<p>LichtBlick and the WWF have a new, common website, [energiewendebeschleunigen.de](http://www.energiewendebeschleunigen.de/dashboard/)&nbsp;(Website in German, literally "acclerating the Energy turnaround"). The dashboard shows the currently installed capacity in Renewables compared to Fossil energy sources (100GW vs. 90GW), the current energy mix and the CO2 output of Germany. The site is a good overview of what works, and what needs more work done. For example, while electricity in Germany is on track towards renewables, electrification of mobility is lagging.
