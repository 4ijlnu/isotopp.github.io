It's about an artist using technology disguised as ritual magic to trap self-driving cars (and similar shenanigans). The assessent was correct, this is beautiful. The image from the article shown above shows a self-driving car inside fake street markings. The broken lines allow the cars logic to enter the circle, the unbroken linkes mark a demarcation that must not be crossed, hence the car can never leave. It ties back to a story my driving instructor told me. He was making a point about "How things are being presented matters", relating about a beginners driver who had been told to imagine unbroken lines as a "wall that cannot be crossed" and who because of that had problems - sometimes rules must be broken to preserve their meaning and spirit. &nbsp;</p>
