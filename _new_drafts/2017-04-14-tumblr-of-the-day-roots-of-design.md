<p>I have just finished reading the Project Zero Blog entries about the [Broadcom Wifi SoC used in Cellphones](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.nl/2017/04/over-air-exploiting-broadcoms-wi-fi_4.html), and [how to utilise that SoC to take over the main CPU of a phone](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.nl/2017/04/over-air-exploiting-broadcoms-wi-fi_11.html). While this is awesome reading, it reminded me about my interest in taking up a career in landscape gardening. So here is my Tumblr of the Day recommendation for today: [Roots of Design](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/roots-of-design/id967648499), a podcast aboutâ€¦ Landscape Gardening. It's awesome, exploit free and about design, so it's everything that IT isn't. It's also defunct, the last episode is from almost 2 years ago, so it has at least something in common with the patch level of your phone.</p>
