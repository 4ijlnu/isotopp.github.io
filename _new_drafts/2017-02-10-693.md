<p> ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_6916-150x150.jpg) Die Klimaretter are reporting: [Theft of solar modules on the rise](http://www.klimaretter.info/energie/hintergrund/22632-solarmodule-bei-dieben-immer-beliebter)&nbsp;(article in German). The article makes and supports the claim that solar modules are being stolen by organized crime in Germany, and explains ways to make that harder to perform and the goods easier to track. Solutions include marking and registration of all modules, GPS/GSM combos in components and special screws that require specific tools to remove panels without damaging them. Wind turbines are also subject to theft and damage, but here mostly for the copper cables in them.</p>
