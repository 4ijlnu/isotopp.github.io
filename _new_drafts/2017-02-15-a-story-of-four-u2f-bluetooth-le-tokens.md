His verdict:</p>
<p>> If you have to have Bluetooth support, go for the Feitian, or wait until Yubico launches their version. If you do not need Bluetooth support, stick with Yubikey for now.</p>
<p> Tested were Yubico Yubikey 4, HyperSecu HyperFido U2F, VASCO SecureCLick, and Feitian Multipass.</p>
