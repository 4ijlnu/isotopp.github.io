<p> ![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/google-150x150.jpg) Hooray, [EU data protection authorities confirm compliance of Google Cloud commitments for international data flows!](https://www.blog.google/topics/google-cloud/eu-data-protection-authorities-confirm-compliance-google-cloud-commitments-international-data-flows/) exclaims Google. But on the other hand, [Google ordered to hand over foreign emails to FBI, unlike Microsoft](http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-ordered-to-hand-over-foreign-emails-to-fbi-unlike-microsoft/). With legal instabilities and conflicting signals like these, are you running your crap in a public cloud owned and operated by a US company? You probably should, it's still better infra than you could create yourself. But the legal nonframework around it - it is not helping at all.</p>
