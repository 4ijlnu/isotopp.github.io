<p>> We are so proud to represent LGBTQ+ voices on our platform -- they're a key part of what YouTube is all about. The intention of Restricted Mode is to filter out mature content for the tiny subset of users who want a more limited experience. LGBTQ+ videos are available in Restricted Mode, but videos that discuss more sensitive issues may not be. We regret any confusion this has caused and are looking back into your concerns. We appreciate your feedback and passion for making YouTube such an inclusive, diverse, and vibrant community.</p>

That boycott has hit them, so they were forced to [react](https://9to5google.com/2017/03/21/youtube-response-to-ads-on-hate-videos/))</p>
