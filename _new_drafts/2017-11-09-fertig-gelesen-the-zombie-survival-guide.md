<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/zombie-survival-196x300.jpg)](https://www.amazon.de/Zombie-Survival-Guide-Complete-Protection-ebook/dp/B00YLQY8K2) Max Brooks, author of World War Z, delivers a straight on, zero tongue in cheek, nitty-gritty survival guide for the coming Zombie Apocalypse. The book delivers exactly what is promised in the table of contents: The Solanum Virus and how it works and does not work, Weapons and Combat Techniques that work, defending your home, public spaces or other places, how to organise a breakout or run, useful equipment to have or to loot, and then fighting back and finally containing the outbreak. The book concludes with a list of documented outbreaks in the past, and their handling. The book is written completely straight and is full of useful advice for fighting a Zombie Apocalypse or containing an outbreak, but also a useful source book for roleplaying and storytelling games. [The Zombie Survival Guide](https://www.amazon.de/Zombie-Survival-Guide-Complete-Protection-ebook/dp/B00YLQY8K2) Max Brooks EUR 4.99 ([Kindle](https://www.amazon.de/Zombie-Survival-Guide-Complete-Protection-ebook/dp/B00YLQY8K2))</p>
