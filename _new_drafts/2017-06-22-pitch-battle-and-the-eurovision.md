<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/pitchbattle.jpg)](https://twitter.com/hzulla/status/877960968453541888) Britain and the Eurovision have a very reliable history, and it is not really a very successful one ("Still a better result than Germany!"). So, why not try something different? [Pitch Battle](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08w8gmh) is an Acapella Casting Show on BBC One. That is, it's a casting show for people who can actually sing, because nothing but singing is allowed. Using Pitch Battle to select the Eurovision Entry 2018, or the group - how about that? Yeah, I thought you'd like that plan.</p>
