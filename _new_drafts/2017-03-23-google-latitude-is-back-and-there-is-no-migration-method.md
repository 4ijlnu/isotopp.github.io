<p>Google Maps [reintroduces their Latitude feature](https://blog.google/products/maps/share-your-trips-and-real-time-location-google-maps/), in which you can share your current position with others in real time ([compare with 2009](http://googlemobile.blogspot.nl/2009/02/locate-your-friends-in-real-time-with.html)). [![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/01-share_location-light_gray_FINAL-300x271.gif)](https://blog.google/products/maps/share-your-trips-and-real-time-location-google-maps/)<!--more--> According to [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u62nPKgLJeg)&nbsp;you can share your position for a limited time and thankfully, permanently too. According to all documentation, there are no contact groups, so you have to add individuals one by one instead of integration with Contact Groups or Google plus circles. And to make everything more painful, there is no migration of Location-sharing enabled Google plus groups (the non-funcitonal Latitude successor) to this feature, because "Fuck you!". I have no idea if this is mobile only or will also be visible with a&nbsp;proper UI on their Google Maps web interface.</p>
