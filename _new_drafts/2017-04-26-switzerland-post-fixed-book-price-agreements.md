<p>Swiss NZZ has [an article](https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/buchhandel-das-ende-der-preisbindung-ueberwunden-ld.1288268) about the Buchpreisbindung, [fixed book price agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_book_price_agreement). These are still a thing in Germany, and have been in Switzerland, in the past. In Switzerland, fixed book prices was not prolonged in May 2007. In the political followup, it came to &nbsp;a public referendum in March 2012, and that did not come through, repealing the agreement permanently. Since then, book prices fell by 20%, and variances in price mostly have been caused by the price of the swiss franc in relation to the Euro. 30% of the book shows also closed, but that is more likely caused by digitization of reading than by the price agreement going away.<!--more--> Complete statistics of the book market are hard to come by, because the market increasingly becomes fragmented and opaque: specifically ebook sales happen across national borders, Amazon is not really publishing numbers, and an increasing number of book sales are direct sales, the authors not going through publishers, or not even producing a material copy of the work, but selling ebook only. Many such works also have no standard ISBN and are not registered in any way. The article, and the traditional publishing business are mourning the loss of structure in the market, because they are losing political power and public subsidies in the same proportion as the market loses its rigid structure. This, for many of them, apparently is a larger problem than the loss of the fixed book price agreement. &nbsp;</p>
