<p>The current vacation is hard on me, because I hardly get to use my own computer - the best wife of all and the Schnuppel both compete for time on my machine in order to play [Transport Fever](http://store.steampowered.com/app/446800/) and [Cities: Skylines](http://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/). That's an annoyance not only because I can't get the keyboard, but also because a MacBook pro apparently sucks as a gaming machine. So [this website](http://www.ultrabookreview.com/10939-laptops-nvidia-1070-1080/) lists a bunch of relatively recent laptops with proper graphics cards,&nbsp;and household peace seems to require a premade machine and a transportable device (not a desktop device). What would be your recommendation (see above, and maybe [Elite Dangerous](http://store.steampowered.com/app/359320/) and [No Man's Sky](http://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/)), and why?</p>
