<p>[![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/the-auto-god.jpg)](https://iconicphotos.org/2017/05/20/j-r-eyerman-at-drive-in/) The Tumblr of the Day is [Iconic Photos](https://iconicphotos.org/2017/05/20/j-r-eyerman-at-drive-in/), which currently&nbsp;comes with the image above and a very nice text explaining the history and making-of of the image and the rise and fall of the drive-in cinema ("By 1958, 83% of American households had a television set in their homes, up from 9% in 1950."). Iconic Photos is on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/iconicphotos), too.</p>
