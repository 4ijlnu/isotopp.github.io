<p>Jean-Baptiste Qu√©ru looks at US Manufacturing vs Trade in [this Google plus article](https://plus.google.com/+JeanBaptisteQueru/posts/5fwGf3REcvY):</p>
<p>> Here's what I read in it, at a high level:<br />
> - The US didn't lose manufacturing to trade, since manufacturing went up after trade agreements were signed in 1994 and 2001.<br />
> - US workers didn't lose jobs to immigrants, since that would typically result in an increase in the workforce (more workers, paid less, individually less productive). Instead, the jobs truly disappeared.</p>
<p> He concludes that trade agreements increase trade, increase&nbsp;revenue, which is then invested into manufacturing automation, which leads to a drop in employment. His analysis is based on data shown in [this report](https://www.aei.org/publication/october-2-is-manufacturing-day-so-lets-recognize-americas-world-class-manufacturing-sector-and-factory-workers/) from the [American Enterprise Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Enterprise_Institute), a Washington based neoconservative think tank.</p>
