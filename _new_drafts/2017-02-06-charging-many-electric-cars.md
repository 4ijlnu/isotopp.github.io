<p>[caption id="attachment\_459" align="alignleft" width="300"][![](http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tesla-300x155.jpg)](https://electrek.co/2017/02/03/tesla-controllable-charge-load-app-netherlands/) Charging Tesla[/caption] So not every charge of an electric car has to be a fast charge. A small scale pilot in the Netherlands tries to orchestrate the charging of&nbsp;the6000 Teslas, [electrek reports](https://electrek.co/2017/02/03/tesla-controllable-charge-load-app-netherlands/), but has been starting with 40 participating owners and their cars only. The smart charging app has now been opened up to all Testla owners in the Netherlands, and allows them to charge cheaper and greener by in turn allowing the App to orchestrate the charge load on the network. The Tesla fleet in the Netherlands at the moment represents a charge load total of 60 MW, and is anticipated to approach 10 GW in 2020, but these estimates are probably already invalid and too low.</p>
