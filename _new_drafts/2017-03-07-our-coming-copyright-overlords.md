<p>[According to the New York Post](http://nypost.com/2017/03/02/apple-execs-vying-for-original-movie-tv-deals/) (yes, I know), Apple's Eddy Cue are looking to improve the original video strategy Apple has (most likely in reaction to Netflix and Youtube). The wording is worrying: </p>
<p>> While at least one of the discussions between Apple and an executive was vague when it came to the tech company’s ultimate goal, the executive was left with the impression that the Cupertino, Calif., company is looking for a **transformative acquisition** and not just a deal to buy TV shows.</p>
<p> and later </p>
<p>> “They talked to Sony and Paramount last week. They are preparing something big,” a source told The Post.</p>
<p> Nobody has anything concrete at the moment, though.</p>
