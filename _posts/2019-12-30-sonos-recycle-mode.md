Sonos is a company that makes Wifi Connected speakers. They
offer acceptable sound quality and an extremely good user
experience. They also so far have never cancelled support for
any of their speakers.

Some of their speakers are now qualified for a Trade-In program,
in particular their 

- Play:5 (1st generation) speaker, 
- the Connect:Amp and 
- the Connect.

The latter two (the Connect products) are somewhat obsolete as
they were necessary when normal Wifi was usually not able to
carry sound data at the required reliability, so Sonos speakers
built their own Wifi Mesh network separately from the usual home
Wifi. With newer Wifi standards and recently also 5 Ghz this was
no longer necessary.

The Play:5 (1st generation) speaker appeared in 2009, 10 years
ago, and was replaced by the 2nd generation in 2015.
Unfortunately I have no idea what kind of hardware the platform
is built on, I have only look into a Play:3 from 2013.

The Play:3 appeared in July 2011, and was discontinued in July
2018. The hardware I had looked at had a MIPS based single core
CPU and 64 MB of memory. Current Sonos hardware is using
Multicore ARM SOCs and have at least four times the amount of
memory.

The Play:1 appeared in October 2013, and was replaced by the
Play One (1st generation) in October 2017. The second generation
Play One added Bluetooth Hardware and a much fatter SOC and even
more memory only one year later. Owners of the 1st gen Play One
are probably currently worst off.

The Trade-In is advertised as follows:

![](uploads/2019/12/sonos-trade-up.png)

You select a device for Trade-Up, and receive a voucher for a
30% rebate on the purchase of a new device. You then have 21
days left to use the old device, after which time it will
permanently cease to function. You can use the voucher to
purchase any new Sonos device, replace the old one and ship the
old device to whatever recycling services in your area accept
it.

That is a normal Trade-In program, minus the part where you
uselessly ship the old hardware across the country to the maker,
which will then hand it over to a recycling service instead of
you doing this.

You can still continue to use the old device as long as it is
supported, you can still sell the old device to others, as long
as it is supported, and you can do whatever else is possible
with the old hardware.

It is pretty clear where this is aiming: Sonos is looking at the
oldest hardware in their lineup and that this hardware is
becoming pretty long in the tooth.

Especially the limited amount of memory makes it increasingly
difficult to even install the most current versions of their
software. New functionality such as Airplay 2, and new services
require more memory and (in case of Airplay 2, also more CPU and
more Wifi bandwidth) that this 10 year old piece of hardware
has. 

They would like to shrink the installed base of this (and soon,
the Play:3), and would like to offer their long-time customers
some kind of bonus and way to upgrade before they have to
disable the hardware because it cannot longer be supported.

Not having to ship the hardware back to Sonos should be a plus,
not a minus. Instead there is a pretty hard blowback on Twitter.
Most people criticise that this bricks the device.

Which is kind of the point in a Trade-In.
